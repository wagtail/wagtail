## What's new

### Site setting permissions

The [](../reference/contrib/settings) app now allows permission over site settings to be granted on a per-site basis. This makes it possible to give non-superuser accounts full control over the configuration of an individual site. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

### Previews support for generic and site settings

The [](../reference/contrib/settings) app now allows previews to be enabled for generic and site setting models through `PreviewableMixin`. This makes it possible to preview your site while editing the settings. For more details, see [](enabling_previews_for_settings). This feature was developed by Sébastien Corbin and Sage Abdullah.

### List layout for images

Image listings now support both grid and list layouts, with a simple toggle for users to switch between the two. This helps CMS users manage larger collections of images, and makes it possible to display more metadata about images in the future.

Thank you to Joel William for implementing this as part of the [Google Summer of Code program](https://wagtail.org/blog/four-contributors-for-gsoc-2025/), with support from Coen van der Kamp, Sage Abdullah, Thibaud Colas, Ben Enright.

### Collapsible StructBlock for block settings

To make it easier to navigate complex structured content, blocks created with `StructBlock` can now be collapsed and expanded like other structured block types. This is an opt-in feature, requiring developers to set `collapsed=False` or `collapsed=True` when reusing the block, or as part of its `Meta` class. A common need for this is block settings, where the block supports a lot of optional fields:

```python
class BlockQuote(StructBlock):
    text = TextBlock()
    attribute_name = CharBlock(blank=True, required=False, label="e.g. Mary Berry")
    # Fields within the settings block will be available but hidden by default.
    settings = ThemeSettingsBlock(collapsed=True)
```

For more information, see [](custom_editing_interfaces_for_structblock) and [](streamfield_block_reference). This feature was implemented by Sage Abdullah, with support from the Wagtail UI team.

### Preview and user bar improvements for headless setups

The live preview and user bar features have been improved to work better in headless setups. The preview panel can now load a cross-domain headless frontend (provided by the wagtail-headless-preview package). The Wagtail user bar has been refactored into a template component, allowing it to be rendered independently and loaded by the headless frontend. Incorporating the user bar into the frontend enables features in the page editor, such as:

 * Live preview scroll restoration
 * Accessibility checks
 * Content metrics (word count, reading time)

For more details, see the documentation on [enabling the user bar](headless_user_bar) and [accessibility checker](headless_accessibility_checker) in headless setups. This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Deprecation of `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton`

The `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton` classes have been deprecated in favour of the generic `ListingButton` and `Button` classes.

The `PageListingButton` class was previously documented as part of the [`register_page_listing_buttons`](register_page_listing_buttons) hook. If you used this hook to add buttons to the page listing, you should now replace `wagtail.admin.widgets.PageListingButton` with `wagtail.admin.widgets.ListingButton`. Using the `PageListingButton` class will continue to work for now, but will raise a deprecation warning.

The `SnippetListingButton` and `UserListingButton` classes were previously documented as part of the [`register_snippet_listing_buttons`](register_snippet_listing_buttons) and [`register_user_listing_buttons`](register_user_listing_buttons) hooks, respectively. If you used these hooks to add buttons to the snippet or user listing, you should now replace `wagtail.snippets.widgets.SnippetListingButton` and `wagtail.users.widgets.UserListingButton` with one of the following:

- Use `wagtail.admin.widgets.Button` if you want the button to appear as an item inside the "More" actions dropdown in the listing.
- Use `wagtail.admin.widgets.ListingButton` if you want the button to appear as a top-level button in the listing.

Using the `SnippetListingButton` or `UserListingButton` classes will continue to work for now, but will raise a deprecation warning.

The `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton` classes will be removed in a future release.

### Using `ListingButton` in `IndexView.get_list_more_buttons` now renders the button as a top-level button

If you have overridden the undocumented `get_list_more_buttons` method on a generic `IndexView` subclass (e.g. for a `ModelViewSet`) and used the `ListingButton` class to add buttons to the "More" actions dropdown, these buttons will now be rendered as top-level buttons in the listing. If you want the buttons to appear inside the "More" actions dropdown, you should use the `Button` class instead.

### `init_new_page` moved to `wagtail.signals`

The [](init_new_page_signal) signal, previously defined in `wagtail.admin.signals`, has now been moved to `wagtail.signals`. Any import lines referencing the old location need to be updated.

### `AccessibilityItem` now accepts an `in_editor` argument

The `AccessibilityItem` user bar item now accepts an {attr}`~wagtail.admin.userbar.AccessibilityItem.in_editor` argument, which is set to `True` when it is instantiated within the page editor. If you [customized the accessibility checker](built_in_accessibility_checker), you should update your code to pass this argument when creating an instance of your `AccessibilityItem` subclass.

```diff
 @hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
 def replace_userbar_accessibility_item(request, items, page):
     items[:] = [
-        CustomAccessibilityItem()
+        CustomAccessibilityItem(in_editor=item.in_editor)
         if isinstance(item, AccessibilityItem) else item
         for item in items
     ]
```

If you do not update your code, the `AccessibilityItem` will continue to work, but the `in_editor` argument will always be `False`. Wagtail does not currently use this argument, but it may do so in the future. It may also be utilized by users for [cross-domain headless setups](headless_accessibility_checker).

### `wagtail.telepath` and `wagtail.widget_adapters` moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath`

The `wagtail.telepath` module has now been moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath`, and `wagtail.widget_adapters` has been moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath.widgets`. Any import lines referencing the old locations need to be updated.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### List view for image listings

The `wagtailimages` listing view templates have been adapted to support both list and grid layout. Those adaptations should be replicated for any overrides or reuse of those templates.

### Removal of `wagtailadmin/js/telepath/telepath.js`

The JavaScript file `wagtailadmin/js/telepath/telepath.js` is no longer required, as Telepath initialization is now handled within `wagtailadmin/js/core.js`. Any templates used within the Wagtail admin should remove imports of this file; any front-end code using Telepath outside of the Wagtail admin should use the `telepath.js` supplied with [the `telepath` package](https://wagtail.github.io/telepath/) or [`telepath-unpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telepath-unpack).
