# UI Guidelines

Wagtailâ€™s user interface is built with:

- **HTML** using [Django templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/).
- **CSS** using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **SVG** for our icons, minified with [SVGO](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
- **JavaScript** with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Linting and formatting

Here are the available commands:

- `make lint` will run all linting, `make lint-server` lints templates, `make lint-client` lints JS/CSS
- `make format` will run all formatting and fixing of linting issues. There is also `make format-server` and `make format-client`

Have a look at our Makefile tasks and package.json scripts if you prefer more granular options.

## HTML guidelines

We use [djhtml](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml) for formatting and [Curlylint](https://www.curlylint.org/) for linting.

- Write [valid](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), [semantic](https://html5doctor.com/element-index/) HTML.
- Follow [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/), in particular [No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#no_aria_better_bad_aria).
- Use classes for styling, `data-` attributes for JavaScript behavior, IDs for semantics only.
- For comments, use Django templates syntax instead of HTML.

## CSS guidelines

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting.

- We follow [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/), with a large amount of utilities created with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Familiarise yourself with our [stylelint-config-wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/stylelint-config-wagtail) configuration, which details our preferred code style.
- Use `rems` for `font-size`, because they offer absolute control over text. Additionally, unit-less `line-height` is preferred because it does not inherit a percentage value of its parent element, but instead is based on a multiplier of the `font-size`.
- Always use variables for design tokens such as colors or font sizes, rather than hard-coding specific values.
- We use the `w-` prefix for all styles intended to be reusable by Wagtail site implementers.

## JavaScript guidelines

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

- We follow a laxer version of the [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Familiarise yourself wit our [eslint-config-wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/eslint-config-wagtail) configuration, which details our preferred code style.
