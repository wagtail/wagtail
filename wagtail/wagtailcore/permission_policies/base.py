    A 'permission policy' is an object that handles all decisions about the actions
    users are allowed to perform on a given model. The mechanism by which it does this
    is arbitrary, and may or may not involve the django.contrib.auth Permission model;
    it could be as simple as "allow all users to do everything".

    In this way, admin apps can change their permission-handling logic just by swapping
    to a different policy object, rather than having that logic spread across numerous
    view functions.

    BasePermissionPolicy is an abstract class that all permission policies inherit from.
    The only method that subclasses need to implement is users_with_any_permission;
    all other methods can be derived from that (but in practice, subclasses will probably
    want to override additional methods, either for efficiency or to implement more
    fine-grained permission logic).
