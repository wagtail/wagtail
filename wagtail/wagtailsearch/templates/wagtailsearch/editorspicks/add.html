        <p>Editors picks are a means of recommending specific pages that might not organically come high up in search results. E.g recommending your primary donation page to a user searching with a less common term like "<em>giving</em>".</p>

        <p>The "Search term(s)/phrase" field below must contain the full and exact search for which you wish to provide recommended results, <em>including</em> any misspellings/user error. To help, you can choose from search terms that have been popular with users of your site.</p>
