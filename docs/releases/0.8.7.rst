What's changed
==============

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``wagtailfrontendcache`` no longer tries to purge pages that are not in a site
* The contents of ``<div>`` elements in the rich text editor were not being whitelisted
* Due to the above issue, embeds/images in a rich text field would sometimes be saved into the database in their editor representation
* RoutablePage now prevents ``subpage_urls`` from being defined as a property, which would cause a memory leak
* Added validation to prevent pages being created with only whitespace characters in their title fields
* Users are no longer logged out on changing password when SessionAuthenticationMiddleware (added in Django 1.7) is in use
* Added a workaround for a Python / Django issue that prevented documents with certain non-ASCII filenames from being served
