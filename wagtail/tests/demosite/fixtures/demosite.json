However, these are not evolutionary lineages; change of belly colour and increase of melanin have occurred independently several times in the wagtails, and the colour patterns which actually indicate relationships are more subtle.</p><p><embed alt=\"Wagtail Sproing by Jim Bendon\" embedtype=\"image\" format=\"left\" id=\"12\"/><br/></p><h4>Wagtails are pretty</h4><p>mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data (Voelker, 2002) is of limited use: the suspicion that there is a superspecies of probably 3 white-bellied, black-throated wagtails is confirmed. Also, there is another superspecies in sub-Saharan Africa, three white-throated species with a black breast-band. The remaining five species are highly variable morphologically and their relationships with each other and with the two clades have not yet been satisfactorily explained.<br/></p><p><embed alt=\"Pied wagtail by Marie Hale\" embedtype=\"image\" format=\"right\" id=\"10\"/><br/></p><p>The origin of the genus appears to be in the general area of Eastern Siberia/Mongolia.
