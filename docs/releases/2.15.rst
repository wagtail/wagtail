Wagtail 2.15 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).


What's new
==========

New database search backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail has a new search backend that uses the full-text search features of the database in use. It supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB.

This new search backend replaces both the existing generic database and PostgreSQL-specific search backends.

To switch to this new backend, see the upgrade considerations below.

This feature was developed by Aldán Creo as part of Google Summer of Code.


Bulk actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk actions are now available for Page, User, Image and Document models in the Wagtail Admin, allowing users to perform actions like publication or deletion on groups of objects at once.

This feature was developed by Shohan Dutta Roy, mentored by Dan Braghis, Jacob Topp-Mugglestone, and Storm Heg.


Audit logging for all models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audit logging has been extended so that all models (not just pages) can have actions logged against them. The Site History report now includes logs from all object types, and snippets and ModelAdmin provide a history view showing previous edits to an object. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott, and sponsored by `The Motley Fool <https://www.fool.com/>`_.


Collection management permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permission for managing collections can now be assigned to individual subtrees of the collection hierarchy, allowing sub-teams within a site to control how their images and documents are organised. For more information, see :ref:`collection_management_permissions`. This feature was developed by Cynthia Kiser.


Typed table block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``TypedTableBlock`` block type is available for StreamField, allowing authors to create tables where the cell values are any StreamField block type, including rich text. For more information, see :doc:`/reference/contrib/typed_table_block`. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott, Coen van der Kamp and Scott Cranfill, and sponsored by `YouGov <https://yougov.com/>`_.

Windows high contrast support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of a broad push to improve the accessibility of the administration interface, Wagtail now supports `Windows high contrast mode <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-high-contrast-mode-in-windows-10-fedc744c-90ac-69df-aed5-c8a90125e696>`_. There are remaining known issues but we are confident Wagtail is now much more usable for people relying on this assistive technology.

Individual fixes were implemented by a large number of first-time and seasoned contributors:

 * Comments icon now matches link colour (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Sidebar logo is now visible in high contrast mode (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Icons in links and buttons now use the appropriate “active control” colour (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Comments dropdown now has a border (Shariq Jamil, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Make StreamField block chooser menu buttons appear as buttons (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Add a separator to identify the search forms (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Update tab styles so the active tab can be identified (Dmitrii Faiazov, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Make hamburger menu a button for tab and high contrast accessibility (Amy Chan, Dan Braghis)
 * Tag fields now have the correct background (Desai Akshata, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Added sidebar vertical seperation with main content (Onkar Apte, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Added vertical separation between field panels (Chakita Muttaraju, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Switch widgets on/off states are now visually distinguishable (Sakshi Uppoor, Thibaud Colas)
 * Checkbox widgets on/off states are now visually distinguishable (Thibaud Colas, Jacob Topp-Mugglestone, LB (Ben Johnston))

Particular thanks to LB, who reviewed almost all of those contributions, and Kyle Bayliss, who did the initial audit to identify High contrast mode issues.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Database search backends replaced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following search backends (configured in ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS``) have been deprecated:

 - ``wagtail.search.backends.db`` (the default if ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS`` is not specified)
 - ``wagtail.contrib.postgres_search.backend``

Both of these backends have now been replaced by ``wagtail.search.backends.database``. This new
backend supports all of the features of the PostgreSQL backend, and also supports other databases.
It will be made the default backend in Wagtail 3.0. To enable the new backend, edit (or add) the
``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS`` setting as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.search.backends.database',
        }
    }

Also remove ``'wagtail.contrib.postgres_search'`` from ``INSTALLED_APPS`` if this was previously set.

After switching to this backend, you will need to run the ``manage.py update_index`` management
command to populate the search index (see :ref:`update_index`).

If you have used the PostgreSQL-specific ``SEARCH_CONFIG``, this will continue to work as before with the new backend. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.search.backends.database',
            'SEARCH_CONFIG': 'english',
        }
    }

However, as a PostgreSQL specific feature, this will be ignored when using a different database.


Admin homepage panels, summary items and action menu items now use components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _template_components_2_15:

Several Wagtail hooks provide a mechanism for passing Python objects to be rendered as HTML inside admin views, and the APIs for these objects have been updated to adopt a common :doc:`template components </extending/template_components>` pattern. The affected objects are:

 * Homepage panels (as registered with the :ref:`construct_homepage_panels` hook)
 * Homepage summary items (as registered with the :ref:`construct_homepage_summary_items` hook)
 * Page action menu items (as registered with the :ref:`register_page_action_menu_item` and :ref:`construct_page_action_menu` hooks)
 * Snippet action menu items (as registered with the :ref:`register_snippet_action_menu_item` and :ref:`construct_snippet_action_menu` hooks)

User code that creates these objects should be updated to follow the component API. This will typically require the following changes:

 * Homepage panels should be made subclasses of ``wagtail.admin.ui.components.Component``, and the ``render(self)`` method should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``. (Alternatively, rather than defining ``render_html``, it may be more convenient to reimplement it with a template, as per :ref:`creating_template_components`.)
 * Summary item classes can continue to inherit from ``wagtail.admin.site_summary.SummaryItem`` (which is now a subclass of ``Component``) as before, but:

   * Any ``template`` attribute should be changed to ``template_name``;
   * Any place where the ``render(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``;
   * Any place where the ``get_context(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``get_context_data(self, parent_context)``.

 * Action menu items for pages and snippets can continue to inherit from ``wagtail.admin.action_menu.ActionMenuItem`` and ``wagtail.snippets.action_menu.ActionMenuItem`` respectively - these are now subclasses of ``Component`` - but:

   * Any ``template`` attribute should be changed to ``template_name``;
   * Any ``get_context`` method should be renamed to ``get_context_data``;
   * The ``get_url``, ``is_shown``, ``get_context_data`` and ``render_html`` methods no longer accept a ``request`` parameter. The request object is available in the context dictionary as ``context['request']``.


Passing callables as messages in ``register_log_actions`` is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When defining new action types for :ref:`audit logging <audit_log>` with the :ref:`register_log_actions` hook, it was previously possible to pass a callable as the message. This is now deprecated - to define a message that depends on the log entry's data, you should now create a subclass of ``wagtail.core.log_actions.LogFormatter``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from wagtail.core import hooks

    @hooks.register('register_log_actions')
    def additional_log_actions(actions):

        def greeting_message(data):
            return _('Hello %(audience)s') % {
                'audience': data['audience'],
            }
        actions.register_action('wagtail_package.greet_audience', _('Greet audience'), greeting_message)

should now be rewritten as:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from wagtail.core import hooks
    from wagtail.core.log_actions import LogFormatter

    @hooks.register('register_log_actions')
    def additional_log_actions(actions):

        @actions.register_action('wagtail_package.greet_audience')
        class GreetingActionFormatter(LogFormatter):
            label = _('Greet audience')

            def format_message(self, log_entry):
                return _('Hello %(audience)s') % {
                    'audience': log_entry.data['audience'],
                }


``PageLogEntry.objects.log_action`` is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audit logging is now supported on all model types, not just pages, and so the ``PageLogEntry.objects.log_action``
method for logging actions performed on pages is deprecated in favour of the general-purpose ``log`` function. Code that
calls ``PageLogEntry.objects.log_action`` should now import the ``log`` function from ``wagtail.core.log_actions`` and
call this instead (all arguments are unchanged).

Additionally, for logging actions on non-Page models, it is generally no longer necessary to subclass ``BaseLogEntry``; see :ref:`audit_log` for further details.


Removed support for Internet Explorer (IE11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this affects you or your organisation, consider which alternative browsers you may be able to use.
Wagtail is fully compatible with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft’s replacement for Internet Explorer. You may consider using its `IE mode <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-ie-mode>`_ to keep access to IE11-only sites, while other sites and apps like Wagtail can leverage modern browser capabilities.


``search()`` method partial match future deprecation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the ``autocomplete()`` method was introduced, the search method also did partial matching.
This behaviour is will be deprecated in a future release and you should either switch to the new
``autocomplete()`` method or pass ``partial_match=False`` into the search method to opt-in to the
new behaviour. The partial matching in ``search()`` will be completely removed in a future release.
See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_searching_pages`


Change of relation name for admin comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``related_name`` of the relation linking the Page and User models to admin comments has been
changed from ``comments`` to ``wagtail_admin_comments``, to avoid conflicts with third-party apps
that implement commenting. If you have any code that references the ``comments`` relation
(including fixture files), this should be updated to refer to ``wagtail_admin_comments`` instead.
If this is not feasible, the previous behaviour can be restored by adding
``WAGTAIL_COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME = 'comments'`` to your project's settings.

Reusable library code that needs to preserve backwards compatibility with previous Wagtail versions
can find out the relation name as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        from wagtail.core.models import COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME
    except ImportError:
        COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME = 'comments'


Bulk action views not covered by existing hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk action views provide alternative routes to actions like publishing or copying a page.
If your site relies on hooks like ``before_publish_page`` or ``before_copy_page`` to perform
checks, or add additional functionality, those hooks will not be called on the
corresponding bulk action views. If you want to add this to the bulk action views as well,
use the new bulk action hooks: :ref:`before_bulk_action` and :ref:`after_bulk_action`.
