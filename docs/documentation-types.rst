Documentation in four modes of information delivery
===================================================

.. rst-class:: intro
Wagtail documentation is written in four modes of information delivery.
Each type of information delivery has a purpose and targets a specific audience.

  * :ref:`doc-style-tutorial`, learning-oriented
  * :ref:`doc-style-how-to-guide`, goal-oriented
  * :ref:`doc-style-reference`, information-oriented
  * :ref:`doc-style-explanation`, understanding-oriented

Write in style
--------------

Each page of the Wagtail documentation should be written in **one** mode of information delivery.

Mixing types of information delivery on a single page is bad style.
These pages are are confusing to read, and harder to understand.
It is best to split documents that mix the types of information delivery.
Add links to the first section of each document to cross reference the same topic.

Writing documentation in a specific mode  will help our users to understand, and quickly find what they are looking for.

Tutorial
--------

Tutorials are designed to be a **learning-oriented** resource that take
newcomers by the hand and guide them through a specific topic. To facilitate effective
learning, tutorials provide examples to illustrate the subjects they cover.

They may not necessarily follow best-practices by the letter. They are
designed to make it easier to get started.
