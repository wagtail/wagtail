What's new
==========


Elasticsearch 2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now supports Elasticsearch 2. Note that you need to change backend in ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS``, if you wish to switch to Elasticsearch 2. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_elasticsearch`


AWS CloudFront support added to cache invalidation module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail's cache invalidation module can now invalidate pages cached in AWS CloudFront when they are updated or unpublished.
This feature was developed by Rob Moorman.

See: :ref:`frontendcache_aws_cloudfront`


Unpublishing subpages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpublishing a page now gives the option to unpublish its subpages at the same time. This feature was developed by Jordi Joan.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``wagtailforms`` module now provides a ``FormSubmissionPanel`` for displaying details of form submissions; see :ref:`wagtailforms_formsubmissionpanel` for documentation. (João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * The Wagtail version number can now be obtained as a tuple using ``from wagtail import VERSION`` (Tim Heap)
 * ``send_mail`` logic has been moved from ``AbstractEmailForm.process_form_submission`` into ``AbstractEmailForm.send_mail``. Now it's easier to override this logic (Tim Leguijt)
 * Added ``before_create_page``, ``before_edit_page``, ``before_delete_page`` hooks (Karl Hobley)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Migrations for wagtailcore and project template are now reversible (Benjamin Bach)
 * The default image format label text ('Full width', 'Left-aligned', 'Right-aligned') is now localised (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Text on the front-end 'password required' form is now marked for translation (Janneke Janssen)
 * Text on the page view restriction form is now marked for translation (Luiz Boaretto)
 * Fixed toggle behaviour of userbar on mobile (Robert Rollins)
 * Image rendition / document file deletion now happens on a post_delete signal, so that files are not lost if the deletion does not proceed (Janneke Janssen)
 * "Your recent edits" list on dashboard no longer leaves out pages that another user has subsequently edited (Michael Cordover, Kees Hink, João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * ``InlinePanel`` now accepts a ``classname`` parameter as per the documentation (emg36, Matt Westcott)
