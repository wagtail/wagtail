## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `Page.save()` no longer automatically calls `full_clean` for draft pages

In previous releases, the `save()` method on page models called the `full_clean` method to apply [model-level validation rules](inv:django#validating-objects), regardless of whether the page was in a draft or live state, unless this was explicitly disabled by passing `clean=False`. As of this release, saving a page in a draft state (`live=False`) will only perform the minimum validation necessary to ensure data integrity: the title must be non-empty, and the slug must be unique within the parent page. Saving a page with `live=True` will apply full validation as before. If you have user code that creates draft pages and requires them to be validated, you must now call `full_clean` explicitly.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### `TAG_LIMIT` and `TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` settings renamed to `WAGTAIL_TAG_LIMIT` and `WAGTAIL_TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED`

The `TAG_LIMIT` and `TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` settings have been renamed to `WAGTAIL_TAG_LIMIT` and `WAGTAIL_TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` respectively. The old settings will continue to work for now, but will be removed in a future release.
