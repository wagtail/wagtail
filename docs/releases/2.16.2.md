## Upgrade considerations

### Jinja2 compatibility

Developers using Jinja2 templating should note that the template tags in this release (and earlier releases in the 2.15.x and 2.16.x series) are compatible with Jinja2 2.11.x and 3.0.x. Jinja2 2.11.x is unmaintained and requires ``markupsafe`` to be pinned to version ``<2.1`` to work; Jinja2 3.1.x has breaking changes and is not compatible. We therefore recommend that you use Jinja2 3.0.x, or 2.11.x with fully pinned dependencies.
