## What's new

### Universal listings continued

Continuing work on the Universal Listings project, this release rolls out universal listing styles for the following views:

 * Image listings
 * Document listings
 * Site and locale listings
 * Page and snippet history views
 * Form builder submissions
 * Collections listings
 * Groups
 * Users
 * Workflow and task views
 * Search promotions index views
 * Redirects index

Universal listing components like header buttons have also been tweaked to improve usability, and the `PageListingViewSet` now includes `ChooseParentView` to allow creating pages from custom page listings.

Thank you to everyone who worked on these features: Ben Enright, Sage Abdullah, Rohit Sharma, Storm Heg, Temidayo Azeez, and Abdelrahman Hamada.

### Information-dense admin interface

Wagtail now provides a way for CMS users to control the information density of the admin interface, via their user profile preferences.
The new setting allows switching between the "default" density and a new "snug" mode, which reduces the spacing and size of UI elements.

It’s also possible for site implementers to customize this for the needs of their project – see [](custom_ui_information_density).

This feature was developed by Ben Enright and Thibaud Colas.

### Custom per-page-type listings

A new viewset class `PageListingViewSet` has been introduced, allowing developers to create custom page listings for specific page types similar to those previously provided by the Modeladmin package - see [](custom_page_listings). This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

### Keyboard shortcuts overview

A new dialog is available from the help menu, providing an overview of keyboard shortcuts available in the Wagtail admin. This feature was developed by Karthik Ayangar and Rohit Sharma.

### Better guidance for password-protected content

Wagtail now includes extra guidance in its [private pages](private_pages) and [private collections (documents)](private_collections) forms, to warn users about the pitfalls of the "shared password" option.
For projects with higher security requirements, it's now possible to disable the shared password option entirely.
Thank you to Rohit Sharma, Salvo Polizzi, and Jake Howard for implementing those changes.

### Favicon images generation

For sites managing favicons via the CMS, Wagtail now supports [`.ico` favicon generation](favicon_generation), with `format-ico`:

```html+django
<link rel="icon" href="{% image favicon_image format-ico %}" />
```

This feature was developed by Jake Howard.

### CVE-2024-32882: Permission check bypass when editing a model with per-field restrictions through `wagtail.contrib.settings` or `ModelViewSet`

This release addresses a permission vulnerability in the Wagtail admin interface. If a model has been made available for editing through the [`wagtail.contrib.settings`](/reference/contrib/settings) module or [ModelViewSet](modelviewset), and the permission argument on FieldPanel has been used to further restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check on the individual field, allowing them to update its value.

The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected.

Many thanks to Ben Morse and Joshua Munn for reporting this issue, and Jake Howard and Sage Abdullah for the fix. For further details, please see [the CVE-2024-32882 security advisory](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-w2v8-php4-p8hc).

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Changes to `SubmissionsListView` class

As part of the Universal Listings project, the `SubmissionsListView` for listing form submissions in the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app has been refactored to become a subclass of `wagtail.admin.views.generic.base.BaseListingView`. As a result, the class has undergone a number of changes, including the following:

- The filtering mechanism has been reimplemented to use django-filter.
- The `ordering` attribute has been renamed to `default_ordering`.
- The template used to render the view has been significantly refactored to use the new universal listings UI.


### `register_user_listing_buttons` hook signature changed

The function signature for the [`register_user_listing_buttons`](register_user_listing_buttons) hook was updated to accept a `request_user` argument instead of `context`. If you use this hook, make sure to update your function signature to match the new one. The old signature with `context` will continue to work for now, but the context only contains the request object. Support for the old signature will be removed in a future release.

### `PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` has changed to `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE`

The setting `PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` has been deprecated, it will continue to work until a future release but the new name for this same setting will be `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` to align with other settings naming conventions.

See [](frontend_authentication).

### `DOCUMENT_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` has changed to `WAGTAILDOCS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE`

The setting `DOCUMENT_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` has been deprecated, it will continue to work until a future release but the new name for this same setting will be `WAGTAILDOCS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE` to align with other settings naming conventions.

See [](frontend_authentication).

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Removal of `html5lib` dependency

Wagtail now uses `html.parser` for its rich text processing, and no longer depends on `html5lib`. If your project relies on `html5lib`, update rich text code to use Wagtail’s documented rich text APIs like [rewrite handlers](rich_text_rewrite_handlers) and [format converters](rich_text_format_converters). Or update project dependencies to include `html5lib`.

### Deprecation of `user_listing_buttons` template tag

The undocumented `user_listing_buttons` template tag has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### Deprecation of `wagtailusers_groups:users` URL pattern

The undocumented `wagtailusers_groups:users` URL pattern has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are using `reverse` with this URL pattern name, you should update your code to use the `wagtailusers_users:index` URL pattern name and the group ID as the `group` query parameter. For example:

```python
reverse('wagtailusers_groups:users', args=[group.id])
```

should be updated to:

```python
reverse('wagtailusers_users:index') + f'?group={group.id}'
```

The corresponding `wagtailusers_groups:users_results` URL pattern has been removed as part of this change.

A redirect from the old URL pattern to the new one has been added to ensure that existing URLs continue to work. This redirect will be removed in a future release.

### Deprecation of `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers

The undocumented usage of the JavaScript `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers will be removed in a future release.

The following `chooserUrl` object values will be impacted.

-   `anchorLinkChooser`
-   `documentChooser`
-   `emailLinkChooser`
-   `embedsChooser`
-   `externalLinkChooser`
-   `imageChooser`
-   `pageChooser`

Overriding these inner values on the global `window.chooserUrls` object will still override their usage in the Draftail choosers for now but this capability will be removed in a future release.

#### Example

It's recommended that usage of this global is removed in any customizations or third party packages and instead a custom Draftail Entity be used instead. See example below.

##### Old

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

@hooks.register("insert_editor_js")
def editor_js():
    return format_html(
        """
        <script>
            window.chooserUrls.myCustomChooser = '{0}';
        </script>
        """,
        reverse("myapp_chooser:choose"),
    )
```

##### New

Remove the `insert_editor_js` hook usage and instead pass the data needed via the Entity's data.

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

from django.urls import reverse_lazy

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def register_my_custom_feature(features):
    # features.register_link_type...

    features.register_editor_plugin(
        "draftail",
        "custom-link",
        draftail_features.EntityFeature(
            {
                "type": "CUSTOM_ITEM",
                "icon": "doc-full-inverse",
                "description": gettext_lazy("Item"),
                "chooserUrls": {
                    # Important: `reverse_lazy` must be used unless the URL path is hard-coded
                    "myChooser": reverse_lazy("myapp_chooser:choose")
                },
            },
            js=["..."],
        ),
    )

```

#### Overriding existing `chooserUrls` values

To override existing chooser Entities' `chooserUrls` values, here is an example of an unsupported monkey patch can achieve a similar goal.

However, it's recommended that a [custom Entity be created](creating_new_draftail_editor_entities) to be registered as a replacement feature for Draftail customizations as per the documentation.

```py
# .../wagtail_hooks.py
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

from wagtail import hooks

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def override_embed_feature_url(features):
    features.plugins_by_editor["draftail"]["embed"].data["chooserUrls"]["embedsChooser"] = reverse_lazy("my_embeds:chooser")
```

### Deprecation of `window.initBlockWidget` to initialize a StreamField block

The undocumented global function `window.initBlockWidget` has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Any complex customizations that have re-implemented parts of this functionality will need to be modified to adopt the new approach that uses Stimulus and avoids inline scripts.

The usage of this new approach is still unofficial and could change in the future, it's recommended that the documented `BlockWidget` and `StreamField` approaches be used instead.

However, for comparison, here is the old and new approach below.

### Old

Assuming we are using Django's `format_html` to prepare the HTML output with `JSON.dumps` strings for the block data values.

The old approach would call the `window.initBlockWidget` global function with an inline script as follows:

```html
<div
    id="{id}"
    data-block="{block_json}"
    data-value="{value_json}"
    data-error="{error_json}"
></div>
<script>
    initBlockWidget('{id}');
</script>
```

### New

In the new approach, we no longer need to attach an inline script but instead use the Stimulus data attributes to attach the behavior with the `w-block` identifier as follows:

```html
<div
    id="{id}"
    data-block
    data-controller="w-block"
    data-w-block-data-value="{block_json}"
    data-w-block-arguments-value="[{value_json},{error_json}]"
></div>
```

### Removal of jQuery from base client-side Widget and BoundWidget classes

The JavaScript base classes `Widget` and `BoundWidget` that provide client-side access to form widgets (see [](streamfield_widget_api)) no longer use jQuery. The `input` property of `BoundWidget` (previously a jQuery collection) is now a native DOM element, and the `element` argument passed to the `BoundWidget` constructor (previously a jQuery collection) is now passed as a native DOM element if the HTML representation consists of a single element, and an iterable of elements (`NodeList` or array) otherwise. User code that extends these classes should be updated accordingly.

### `window.URLify` deprecated

The undocumented client-side global util `window.URLify` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

If this was required for slug field behavior, it's recommended that the `SlugInput` widget be used instead. This will automatically convert values entered into a suitable slug in the browser while respecting the global configuration `WAGTAIL_ALLOW_UNICODE_SLUGS`.

```python
from wagtail.admin.widgets.slug import SlugInput
# ... other imports

class MyPage(Page):
    promote_panels = [
        FieldPanel("slug", widget=SlugInput),
        # ... other panels
    ]
```

If you require this for custom JavaScript functionality, it's recommended you either include your own implementation from the original [Django URLify source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wagtail/wagtail/stable/6.0.x/wagtail/admin/static_src/wagtailadmin/js/vendor/urlify.js). Alternatively, the [`slugify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify) or [`parameterize` (a Django URLify port)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parameterize) NPM packages might be suitable.

### `window.XRegExp` polyfill removed

The legacy `window.XRegExp` global polyfill util has been removed and will throw an error if called.

Instead, any usage of this should be updated to the well supported [browser native Regex implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions).

```javascript
// old
const newStr = XRegExp.replace(originalStr, XRegExp('[ab+c]', 'g'), '')

// new (with RegExp)
const newStr = originalStr.replace(new RegExp('[ab+c]', 'g'), '')
// OR
const newStr = originalStr.replace(/[ab+c]/g, '')
```
