## What's new

### Image renditions can now be prefetched by filter

When using a queryset to render a list of images, you can now use the ``prefetch_renditions()`` queryset method to prefetch the renditions needed for rendering with a single extra query, similar to ``prefetch_related``. If you have many renditions per image, you can also call it with filters as arguments - ``prefetch_renditions("fill-700x586", "min-600x400")`` - to fetch only the renditions you intend on using for a smaller query. For long lists of images, this can provide a significant boost to performance. See [](prefetching_image_renditions) for more examples. This feature was developed by Tidiane Dia and Karl Hobley.

## Upgrade considerations

### `base_url_path` keyword argument added to AdminURLHelper

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` class now accepts a `base_url_path` keyword argument on its constructor. Custom subclasses of this class should be updated to accept this keyword argument.

### Dropped support for Safari 13

Safari 13 will no longer be officially supported as of this release, this deviates the current support for the last 3 version of Safari by a few months and was required to add better support for RTL languages.

### `PageRevision` replaced with `Revision`

The `PageRevision` model has been replaced with a generic `Revision` model. If you use the `PageRevision` model in your code, make sure that:

 * Creation of `PageRevision` objects should be updated to create `Revision` objects using the page's `id` as the `object_id`, the default `Page` model's content type as the `base_content_type`, and the page's specific content type as the `content_type`.
 * Queries that use the `PageRevision.objects` manager should be updated to use the `Revision.page_revisions` manager.
 * `Revision` queries that use `Page.id` should be updated to cast the `Page.id` to a string before using it in the query (e.g. by using `str()` or `Cast("page_id", output_field=CharField())`).
 * `Page` queries that use `PageRevision.page_id` should be updated to cast the `Revision.object_id` to an integer before using it in the query (e.g. by using `int()` or `Cast("object_id", output_field=IntegerField())`).
 * Access to `PageRevision.page` should be updated to `Revision.content_object`.

If you maintain a package across multiple Wagtail versions that includes a model with a `ForeignKey` to the `PageRevision` model, you can create a helper function to correctly resolve the model depending on the installed Wagtail version, for example:

```python
from django.db import models
from wagtail import VERSION as WAGTAIL_VERSION


def get_revision_model():
    if WAGTAIL_VERSION >= (4, 0):
        return "wagtailcore.Revision"
    return "wagtailcore.PageRevision"


class MyModel(models.Model):
    # Before
    # revision = models.ForeignKey("wagtailcore.PageRevision")
    revision = models.ForeignKey(get_revision_model(), on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```


### `AdminChooser` replaced with `BaseChooser`

Custom choosers should no longer use `wagtail.admin.widgets.chooser.AdminChooser` which has been replaced with `wagtail.admin.widgets.chooser.BaseChooser`.
