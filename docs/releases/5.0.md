The following features deprecated in Wagtail 4.0 have been fully removed. See [Wagtail 4.0 release notes](/releases/4.0) for details on these changes, including how to remove usage of these features:

### `Page.get_static_site_paths` method removed

The undocumented `Page.get_static_site_paths` method (which returns a generator of URL paths for use by static site generator packages) has been removed. Packages relying on this functionality should provide their own fallback implementation.
