## What's new

### Django 5.0 support

This release adds support for Django 5.0. The support has also been backported to Wagtail 5.2 LTS.

### New developer tutorial

A new [developer tutorial](../tutorial/index) series has been added to the documentation. This series builds upon the pre-existing [](/getting_started/tutorial), going through the creation and deployment of a portfolio website.

This tutorial series was created by Damilola Oladele as part of the Google Season of Docs program, with support from Meagen Voss, and Thibaud Colas. We also thank Storm Heg, Kalob Taulien, Kátia Nakamura, Mariusz Felisiak, and Rachel Smith for their support and feedback as part of the project.

### Universal listings

Following design improvements to the page listing view, Wagtail now provides a unified search and filtering interface for all listings. This will improve navigation capabilities, particularly for sites with a large number of pages or where content tends to use a flat structure.

In this release, the universal listing interface is available for Pages, Snippets, and Forms.

This feature was developed by Ben Enright, Matt Westcott, Nick Lee, Thibaud Colas, and Sage Abdullah.

### Right-to-left language support

The admin interface now supports right-to-left languages, such as Persian, Arabic, Hebrew. Though there are still some areas that need improvement, all admin views will now be displayed in the correct direction. Review our [UI guidelines](../contributing/ui_guidelines) for guidance on supporting right-to-left languages in admin interface customizations.

Thank you to Thibaud Colas, Badr Fourane, and Sage Abdullah for their work on this long-requested improvement.

### Accessibility checker in page editor

The [built-in accessibility checker](authoring_accessible_content) now displays as a side panel within page and snippet editors supporting preview. The new "Checks" side panel only shows accessibility-related issues for pages with the userbar enabled in this release, but will be updated to support [any content checks](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063) in the future.

This feature was implemented by Nick Lee, Thibaud Colas, and Sage Abdullah.

## Upgrade considerations - removal of deprecated features from Wagtail 4.2 - 5.1

Features previously deprecated in Wagtail 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 have been fully removed. For additional details on these changes, see:

 * [Wagtail 4.2 release notes](/releases/4.2)
 * [Wagtail 5.0 release notes](/releases/5.0)
 * [Wagtail 5.1 release notes](/releases/5.1)

The most significant changes are highlighted below.

### Removal of ModelAdmin app

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin` app has been removed. If you wish to continue using it, it is available as the external package [`wagtail-modeladmin`](https://github.com/wagtail-nest/wagtail-modeladmin).

### Support for Elasticsearch 5 and 6 dropped

The Elasticsearch 5 and 6 backends have been removed. If you are using one of these backends, you will need to upgrade to Elasticsearch 7 or 8 before upgrading to Wagtail 6.0.

### StreamField no longer requires `use_json_field=True`

The `use_json_field` argument to `StreamField` is no longer required, and can be removed. StreamField now consistently uses JSONField for its database representation, and Wagtail 5.0 required older TextField-based streams to be migrated. As such, `use_json_field` no longer has any effect.

### Other removals

 * The `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_PAGE_EDIT_LOCK` setting is no longer recognised and should be replaced with `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_EDIT_LOCK`.
 * The `Query` model is no longer part of the `wagtail.search` module; it can now be found in the optional `wagtail.contrib.search_promotions` app.
 * The `wagtail.models.UserPagePermissionsProxy` class and `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission`, `get_explorable_root_page` and `users_with_page_permission` functions have been removed; equivalent functionality exists in the `wagtail.permission_policies.pages.PagePermissionPolicy` class.
 * The `permission_type` field of the `GroupPagePermission` model has been removed; the `permission` field (a foreign key to Django's `Permission` model) should be used instead.
 * The legacy moderation system used prior to the introduction of workflows in Wagtail 2.10 has been removed. Any moderation requests still in the queue from before this time will be lost.
 * The Wagtail icon font has been removed; any direct usage of this needs to be converted to SVG icons.
 * Various unused icons deprecated in Wagtail 5.0 have been removed.
 * The `partial_match` argument on `SearchField` and on `search` methods has been removed. `AutocompleteField` and the `autocomplete` method should be used instead.
 * The `insert_editor_css` hook has been removed; the `insert_global_admin_css` hook should be used instead.
 * The `wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache` module now supports `azure-mgmt-cdn` version 10 and `azure-mgmt-frontdoor` version 1 as its minimum supported versions.
 * The `Task.page_locked_for_user` method has been removed; `Task.locked_for_user` should be used instead.
 * The `{% icon %}` template tag no longer accepts `class_name` as an argument; `classname` should be used instead.
 * The `wagtail.tests.utils` module has been removed and can now be found at `wagtail.test.utils`.
 * The template `wagtailadmin/shared/field_as_li.html` has been removed, and should be replaced with `wagtailadmin/shared/field.html` enclosed in an `<li>` tag.
 * The custom client-side events `wagtail:show` and `wagtail:hide` on showing and hiding dialogs have been removed; `w-dialog:show` and `w-dialog:hide` should be used instead.
 * The global Javascript definitions `headerSearch`, `initTagField`, `cancelSpinner` and `unicodeSlugsEnabled` have been removed; these should be replaced with Stimulus controllers.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `SnippetViewSet` & `ModelViewSet` copy view enabled by default

The newly introduced copy view will be enabled by default for all `ModelViewSet` and `SnippetViewSet` classes.

This can be disabled by setting `copy_view_enabled = False`, for example.

```python
class PersonViewSet(SnippetViewSet):
    model = Person
    #...
    copy_view_enabled = False

class PersonViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    model = Person
    #...
    copy_view_enabled = False
```

See [](modelviewset_copy) for additional details about this feature.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### Removed support for Django < 4.2

Django versions prior to 4.2 are no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Django 4.2 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### `SlugInput` widget is now the default for `SlugField` fields

In Wagtail 5.0 a new `SlugInput` admin widget was added to support slug behavior in Page and Page copy forms. This widget was included by default if the `promote_panels` fields layout was customised, causing confusion.

As of this release, any forms that inherit from `WagtailAdminModelForm` (includes page and snippet model editing) will now use the `SlugInput` by default on all models with `SlugField` fields.

Previously, the widget had to be explicitly added.

```python
from wagtail.admin.widgets.slug import SlugInput
# ... other imports

class MyPage(Page):
    promote_panels = [
        FieldPanel("slug", widget=SlugInput),
        # ... other panels
    ]
```

Keeping the widget as above is fine, but will no longer be required. The JavaScript field behavior will be included by default.

```python
# ... imports

class MyPage(Page):
    promote_panels = [
        FieldPanel("slug"),
        # ... other panels
    ]
```

If you do not want this for some reason, you will now need to declare a different widget.

```python
from django.forms.widgets import TextInput
# ... other imports

class MyPage(Page):
    promote_panels = [
        FieldPanel("slug", widget=TextInput), # use a plain text field
        # ... other panels
    ]
```

### Changed handling of database updates of non-live `Page` objects or subclasses of `DraftStateMixin`

Prior to this release, the database record of a `Page` or any subclass of `DraftStateMixin` either contained the live data (if published), the state of the last published version (if unpublished), or the state of the first revision (if never published). Subsequent draft edits would create new `Revision` records, but the main database record would not be updated. As a result, the database record could lag substantially behind the current state of the object, causing unexpected behaviour particularly when unique constraints are in use.

As of this release, the database record of a non-live object will be updated to reflect the draft state of the object. This is unlikely to have a visible effect on existing sites, since the admin backend works with the `Revision` records while the site front-end typically filters out non-live objects. However, any code that relies on the database record being untouched by draft edits (for example, using it to store a specific approved / archived state of the page) may need to be updated.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### `filter_queryset` and `get_filtered_queryset` methods no longer return filters

The undocumented internal methods `filter_queryset(queryset)` on `wagtail.admin.views.generic.IndexView`, and `get_filtered_queryset()` on `wagtail.admin.views.reports.ReportView`, now return just the filtered queryset; previously they returned a tuple of `(filters, queryset)`. The filterset instance is always available as the cached property `self.filters`.

### Deprecation of the undocumented `window.enableDirtyFormCheck` function

The admin frontend `window.enableDirtyFormCheck` will be removed in a future release and as of this release only supports the basic initialization.

The previous approach was to call a window global function as follows.

```javascript
window.enableDirtyFormCheck('.my-form', { alwaysDirty: true, confirmationMessage: 'You have unsaved changes'});
```

The new approach will be data attribute driven as follows.

```text
<form
  method="POST"
  data-controller="w-unsaved"
  data-action="w-unsaved#submit beforeunload@window->w-unsaved#confirm change->w-unsaved#check keyup->w-unsaved#check"
  data-w-unsaved-confirm-value="This page has unsaved changes." // equivalent to `confirmationMessage`.
  data-w-unsaved-force-value="true" // equivalent to `alwaysDirty`.
  data-w-unsaved-watch-value="edits comments" // can add 'comments' if comments is enabled, defaults to only 'edits'.
  >
  ... form contents
</form>
```

### `data-tippy-content` attribute support will be removed

The implementation of the JS tooltips have been fully migrated to the Stimulus `w-tooltip`/`TooltipController` implementation.

Dynamic support for any `data-tippy-content="..."` usage will be removed this release, for example, within chooser modals or dynamic html response data.

Some minimal backwards compatibility support for `data-tippy-content` will work until a future release, but only in the initial HTML response on a page.

#### Data attributes

These HTML data attributes were not documented, but if any custom code implemented custom tooltips, these will need to be changed.

| Old                                          | New                                                    | Notes                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
|                                              | `data-controller="w-tooltip"`                          | Required, new addition for any usage |
| `data-tippy-content="{% trans 'History' %}"` | `data-w-tooltip-content-value="{% trans 'History' %}"` | Required                             |
| `data-tippy-offset="[12, 24]"`               | `data-w-tooltip-offset-value="[12, 24]"`               | Optional, default is no offset       |
| `data-tippy-placement="top"`                 | `data-w-tooltip-placement-value="top"`                 | Optional, default is 'bottom'        |

### Deprecated `WidgetWithScript` base widget class

The undocumented `WidgetWithScript` class that used inline scripts to attach JavaScript to widgets will be removed in a future release.

This approach creates security risks and will not be compliant with CSP support, instead it's recommended that all similar requirements migrate to use the recommended Stimulus JS integration approach.

A full example of how to build this has been documented on (extending client-side behavior)[extending_client_side_stimulus_widget], a basic example is below.

#### Old

```py
from django.forms import Media, widgets


class CustomRichTextArea(WidgetWithScript, widgets.Textarea):
    def render_js_init(self, id_, name, value):
        return f"window.customEditorInitScript({json.dumps(id_)});"

    @property
    def media(self):
        return Media(js=["vendor/custom-editor.js"])
```

#### New

```py
from django.forms import Media, widgets


class CustomRichTextArea(widgets.Textarea):
    def build_attrs(self, *args, **kwargs):
        attrs = super().build_attrs(*args, **kwargs)
        attrs['data-controller'] = 'cusom-editor'

    @property
    def media(self):
        return Media(js=["vendor/custom-editor.js","js/custom-editor-controller.js"])
```

```javascript
// myapp/static/js/custom-editor-controller.js

class CustomEditorController extends window.StimulusModule.Controller {
    connect() {
        window.customEditorInitScript(this.element.id);
    }
}

window.wagtail.app.register('color', CustomEditorController);
```
