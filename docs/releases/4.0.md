 * Convert various pages in the documentation to Markdown (Khanh Hoang, Vu Pham, Daniel Kirkham, LB (Ben) Johnston)

 * Ensure the upgrade notification request for the latest release, which can be disabled via the `WAGTAIL_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK` sends the referrer origin with `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (Karl Hobley)


## Upgrade considerations

### `base_url_path` keyword argument added to AdminURLHelper

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` class now accepts a `base_url_path` keyword argument on its constructor. Custom subclasses of this class should be updated to accept this keyword argument.

### Dropped support for Safari 13

Safari 13 will no longer be officially supported as of this release, this deviates the current support for the last 3 version of Safari by a few months and was required to add better support for RTL languages.

### `PageRevision` replaced with `Revision`

The `PageRevision` model has been replaced with a generic `Revision` model. If you use the `PageRevision` model in your code, make sure that:

 * Creation of `PageRevision` objects should be updated to create `Revision` objects using the page's `id` as the `object_id`, the default `Page` model's content type as the `base_content_type`, and the page's specific content type as the `content_type`.
 * Queries that use the `PageRevision.objects` manager should be updated to use the `Revision.page_revisions` manager.
 * Queries for `Page` objects that use `PageRevision.page_id` should be updated to cast the `Revision.object_id` to an integer before using it in the query.
