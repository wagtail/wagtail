Please do not use GitHub for asking questions. Instead, if you have a general question about Wagtail or about building a site with Wagtail we encourage you to post on our Slack workspace instead of this issue tracker: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack. The maintainers and other community members can provide help and answer your questions there.

Please keep in mind that many of Wagtail's core and expert developers prefer to handle support queries through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wagtail), since the non-realtime format encourages more structured and fully-formed questions. Asking questions on Stack Overflow requires more up-front effort (see Stack Overflow's advice on how to ask a good question), but you may well find you get a better response as a result.

If you've discovered a bug or would like to propose a change please use one of the other issue templates.

Thanks!
