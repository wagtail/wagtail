## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Other features

 * Mark calls to `md5` as not being used for secure purposes, to avoid flagging on FIPS-mode systems (Sean Kelly)
 * Return filters from `parse_query_string` as a `QueryDict` to support multiple values (Aman Pandey)

### Bug fixes

 * Prevent choosers from failing when initial value is an unrecognised ID such as when moving a page from a location where `parent_page_types` would disallow it (Dan Braghis)
 * Move comment notifications toggle to the comments side panel (Sage Abdullah)
 * Remove comment button on InlinePanel fields (Sage Abdullah)
 * Fix missing link to `UsageView` from `EditView` for snippets (Christer Jensen)
 * Prevent lowercase conversions of IndexView column headers (Virag Jain)

### Documentation

 * Document how to add non-ModelAdmin views to a `ModelAdminGroup` (Onno Timmerman)
 * Document how to add StructBlock data to a StreamField (Ramon Wenger)
 * Update ReadTheDocs settings to v2 to resolve urllib3 issue in linkcheck extension (Thibaud Colas)
 * Update documentation for `log_action` parameter on `RevisionMixin.save_revision` (Christer Jensen)
 * Reorganise snippets documentation to cover customisations and optional features (Sage Abdullah)
