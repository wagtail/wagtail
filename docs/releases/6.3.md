## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### Removed support for Python 3.8

Python 3.8 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.9 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### Deprecation of the `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW` setting

The [`WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW`](wagtail_auto_update_preview) setting has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

To disable the automatic preview update feature, set [`WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL = 0`](wagtail_auto_update_preview_interval) in your Django settings instead.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Deprecation of `window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE`

As part of migrating away from inline scripts, the undocumented use of `window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE` as a global has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

**Old**

```html+django
{% block extra_js %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <script>
        window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE = 'SOME_ITEM';
    </script>
{% endblock %}
```

**New**

Update usage of the `wagtailadmin/bulk_actions/footer.html` template include to declare the `item_type`.

```html+django
{% block bulk_actions %}
    {% include 'wagtailadmin/bulk_actions/footer.html' ... item_type="SOME_ITEM" %}
{% endblock %}
```

```{note}
Custom item types for bulk actions are not officially supported yet and this approach is likely to get further changes in the future.
```

### Deprecation of the `{% locales %}` template tag

The undocumented `locales` template tag will be removed in a future release.

If access to JSON locales within JavaScript is needed, use `window.wagtailConfig.LOCALES` instead.

### Deprecation of the `{% js_translation_strings %}` template tag

The undocumented `js_translation_strings` template tag will be removed in a future release.

If access to JSON translation strings within JavaScript is needed, use `window.wagtailConfig.STRINGS` instead.
