What's changed
==============

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Streamfields no longer break on validation error
 * Number of validation errors in each tab in the editor is now correctly reported again
 * Userbar now opens on devices with both touch and mouse (Josh Barr)
 * ``wagtail.wagtailadmin.wagtail_hooks`` no longer calls ``static`` during app load, so you can use ``ManifestStaticFilesStorage`` without calling the ``collectstatic`` command
 * Fixed crash on page save when a custom ``Page`` edit handler has been specified using the ``edit_handler`` attribute (Tim Heap)
