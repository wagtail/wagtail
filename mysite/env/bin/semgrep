# This file is the Semgrep CLI entry point of the Semgrep pip package,
# the Semgrep HomeBrew package, and the Semgrep Docker container.
#
# In the future we may have different entry points when packaging Semgrep
# with Cargo, Npm, Opam, or even with Docker (ideally the entry point would
# be src/main/Main.ml without any wrapper around once osemgrep is finished).
#
# The main purpose of this small wrapper is to dispatch
# either to the legacy pysemgrep (see the pysemgrep script in this
# directory), or to the new osemgrep (accessible via the semgrep-core binary
# under cli/src/semgrep/bin/ or somewhere in the PATH), or even to
# osemgrep-pro (accessible via the semgrep-core-proprietary binary).
#
# It would be faster and cleaner to have a Bash script instead of a Python
# script here, but actually the overhead of Python here is just 0.015s.
# Moreover, it is sometimes hard from a Bash script to find where is installed
# semgrep-core, but it is simple from Python because you can simply use
# importlib.resources. We could also use 'pip show semgrep' from a Bash script
# to find semgrep-core, but will 'pip' be in the PATH? Should we use 'pip' or
# 'pip3'?
# Again, it is simpler to use a Python script and leverage importlib.resources.
# Another alternative would be to always have semgrep-core in the PATH,
# but when trying to put this binary in cli/bin, setuptools is yelling
# and does not know what to do with it. In the end, it is simpler to use
# a *Python* script when installed via a *Python* package manager (pip).
#
# Note that if you modify this file, you will need to `pipenv install --dev`
# if you want to test the change under `pipenv shell`.
