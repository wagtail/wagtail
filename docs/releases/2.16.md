## What's new

### Automatic redirect creation

Wagtail projects using the `wagtail.contrib.redirects` app now benefit from 'automatic redirect creation' - which creates redirects for pages and their descedants whenever a URL-impacting change is made; such as a slug being changed, or a page being moved to a different part of the tree.

This feature should be benefitial to most 'standard' Wagtail projects and, in most cases, will have only a minor impact on responsiveness when making such changes. However, if you find this feature is not a good fit for your project, you can disabled it by adding the following to your project settings:

```python
WAGTAILREDIRECTS_AUTO_CREATE = False
```

Thank you to [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) for kindly sponsoring this feature.
