Upgrade considerations
======================

Jinja2 template tag modules have changed location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to a change in the way template tags are imported in Django 1.9, it has been necessary to move the Jinja2 template tag modules from "templatetags" to a new location, "jinja2tags". The correct configuration settings to enable Jinja2 templates are now as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        # ...
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'extensions': [
                    'wagtail.wagtailcore.jinja2tags.core',
                    'wagtail.wagtailadmin.jinja2tags.userbar',
                    'wagtail.wagtailimages.jinja2tags.images',
                ],
            },
        }
    ]


See: :doc:`/advanced_topics/jinja2`


ContentType-returning methods in wagtailcore are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following internal functions and methods in ``wagtail.wagtailcore.models``, which return a list of ``ContentType`` objects, have been deprecated. Any uses of these in your code should be replaced by the corresponding new function which returns a list of model classes instead:

 * ``get_page_types()`` - replaced by ``get_page_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_subpage_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_subpage_models()``

In addition, note that these methods now return page types that are marked as ``is_creatable = False``, including the base ``Page`` class. (Abstract models are not included, as before.)
