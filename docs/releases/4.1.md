Wagtail 4.1 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).

## What's new

### Other features

 * Add basic keyboard control and screen reader support for page listing re-ordering (Paarth Agarwal, Thomas van der Hoeven)
 * Add `PageQuerySet.private` method as an alias of `not_public` (Mehrdad Moradizadeh)
 * Most images in the admin will now only load once they are visible on screen (Jake Howard)
 * Allow setting default attributes on image tags [](adding_default_attributes_to_images) (Jake Howard)
 * Optimise the performance of the Wagtail userbar to remove duplicated queries, improving page loads when viewing live pages while signed in (Jake Howard)
 * Remove legacy `unbutton` styling for buttons (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Add button variations to the pattern library (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Provide a more accessible page title where the unique information is shown first and the CMS name is shown last (Mehrdad Moradizadeh)
 * Pull out behaviour from `AbstractFormField` to `FormMixin` and `AbstractEmailForm` to `EmailFormMixin` to allow use with subclasses of `Page` [](form_builder_mixins) (Mehrdad Moradizadeh, Kurt Wall)

### Bug fixes

 * Prevent `PageQuerySet.not_public` from returning all pages when no page restrictions exist (Mehrdad Moradizadeh)
