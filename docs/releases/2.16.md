## Upgrade considerations

### Removed support for Django 3.0 and 3.1

Django 3.0 and 3.1 are no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Django 3.2 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### Removed support for Python 3.6

Python 3.6 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.7 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### StreamField ListBlock now returns `ListValue` rather than a list instance

The data type returned as the value of a ListBlock is now a custom class, `ListValue`, rather than a Python `list` object. This change allows it to provide a `bound_blocks` property that exposes the list items as [`BoundBlock` objects](../advanced_topics/boundblocks_and_values) rather than plain values. `ListValue` objects are mutable sequences that behave similarly to lists, and so all code that iterates over them, accesses individual elements, or manipulates them should continue to work. However, code that specifically expects a `list` object (e.g. using `isinstance` or testing for equality against a list) may need to be updated. For example, a unit test that tests the value of a `ListBlock` as follows:

```python
    self.assertEqual(page.body[0].value, ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```

should be rewritten as:

```python
    self.assertEqual(list(page.body[0].value), ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```

### Change to `set` method on tag fields

This release upgrades the [django-taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to 2.x, which introduces one breaking change: the `TaggableManager.set` method now accepts a list of tags as a single argument, rather than a variable number of arguments. Code such as `page.tags.set('red', 'blue')` should be updated to `page.tags.set(['red', 'blue'])`.

### `wagtail.admin.views.generic.DeleteView` follows Django 4.0 conventions

The internal (undocumented) class-based view `wagtail.admin.views.generic.DeleteView` has been updated to align with [Django 4.0's `DeleteView` implementation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/4.0/#deleteview-changes), which uses `FormMixin` to handle POST requests. Any custom deletion logic in `delete()` handlers should be moved to `form_valid()`.

### Renamed admin/expanding-formset.js

`admin/expanding_formset.js` has been renamed to `admin/expanding-formset.js` as part of frontend code clean up work. Check for any customised admin views that are extending expanding formsets, or have overridden template and copied the previous file name used in an import as these may need updating.
