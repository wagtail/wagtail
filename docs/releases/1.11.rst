What's new
==========

Explorer menu built with the admin API and React
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After more than a year of work, the new explorer menu has finally landed! It comes with the following improvements:

 * View all pages - not just the ones with child pages.
 * Better performance, no matter the number of pages or levels in the hierarchy.
 * Navigate the menu via keyboard.
 * View Draft pages, and go to page editing, directly from the menu.

Beyond features, the explorer is built with the new admin API and React components.
This will facilitate further evolutions to make it even faster and user-friendly.
This work is the product of ``4`` Wagtail sprints, and the efforts of ``16`` people, listed here by order of first involvement:

 * Karl Hobley (Cape town sprint, admin API)
 * Josh Barr (Cape town sprint, prototype UI)
 * Thibaud Colas (Ede sprint, Reykjavík sprint)
 * Janneke Janssen (Ede sprint, Reykjavík sprint, Wagtail Space sprint)
 * Rob Moorman (Ede sprint, eslint-config-wagtail, ES6+React+Redux styleguide)
 * Maurice Bartnig (Ede sprint, i18n and bug fixes)
 * Jonny Scholes (code review)
 * Matt Westcott (Reykjavík sprint, refactorings)
 * Sævar Öfjörð Magnússon (Reykjavík sprint)

 * Andy Babic (UI, UX)

 * Bertrand Bordage (testing, documentation)

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Unauthenticated AJAX requests to admin views now return 403 rather than redirecting to the login page (Karl Hobley)
 * ``TableBlock`` options ``afterChange``, ``afterCreateCol``, ``afterCreateRow``, ``afterRemoveCol``, ``afterRemoveRow`` and ``contextMenu`` can now be overridden (Loic Teixeira)


Upgrade considerations
======================

Browser requirements for the new explorer menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new explorer menu does not support IE8, IE9, and IE10. The fallback experience is a link pointing to the explorer pages.
