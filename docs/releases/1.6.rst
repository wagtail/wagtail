Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade considerations
======================

Form builder ``FormField`` models require a migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``choices`` field on the ``wagtailforms.models.AbstractFormField`` model has been changed from a ``CharField`` to a ``TextField``, to allow it to be of unlimited length. If you are using the ``wagtailforms`` module in your project, you will need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations`` and ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading, in order to apply this change to your form page models.
