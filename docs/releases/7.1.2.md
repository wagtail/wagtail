## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Changes to `label_format` behavior in `StructBlock`

In Wagtail 7.1, the `label_format` option for `StructBlock` has been changed to always show the block's original `label` when the block is collapsed, with the `label_format` string shown after it as a summary instead of replacing the `label`. This means that if you had previously set `label_format` to include (or be the same as) the `label`, you would likely want to remove the original `label`'s text from the `label_format` string.

If you wish to hide the summary label entirely (similar to setting `label_format = label` in Wagtail < 7.1), you can set `label_format` to the empty string `""`. This was not possible in Wagtail 7.1, but is now supported as of this release.
