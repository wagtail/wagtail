 * Improved error reporting on image upload, including ability to set a maximum file size via a new setting WAGTAILIMAGES_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE
 * The external image URL generator now keeps persistent image renditions, rather than regenerating them on each request, so it no longer requires a front-end cache

 * Fix: Search indexing now avoids trying to index abstract models
 * Fix: Fixed references to "username" in login form help text for better custom user model support (John-Scott Atlakson)

 * Fix: Editing a page's slug and saving it without publishing could sometimes cause the URL paths of child pages to be corrupted
 * Fix: 'latest_revision_created_at' was being cleared on page publish, causing the page to drop to the bottom of explorer listings
 * Fix: Searches on partial_match fields were wrongly applying prefix analysis to the search query as well as the document (causing e.g. a query for "water" to match against "wagtail")
