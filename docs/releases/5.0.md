* The `BASE_URL` setting is no longer recognised.
* The `ModelAdmin.get_form_fields_exclude` method is no longer passed a `request` argument.
* The `ModelAdmin.get_edit_handler` method is no longer passed a `request` or `instance` argument.
* The `widget_overrides`, `required_fields`, `required_formsets`, `bind_to`, `render_as_object` and `render_as_field` methods on `Panel` (previously `EditHandler`) are removed.

The following features deprecated in Wagtail 4.0 have been fully removed. See [Wagtail 4.0 release notes](/releases/4.0) for details on these changes, including how to remove usage of these features:

* The `wagtail.contrib.settings.models.BaseSetting` class is removed.
* The `Page.get_latest_revision_as_page` method is removed.
* The `page` and `page_id` properties and `as_page_object` method on `Revision` are removed.

* The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.menus.SubMenu` class is removed.

* The `wagtail.snippets.views.snippets.get_snippet_edit_handler` function is removed.

### `Page.get_static_site_paths` method removed

The undocumented `Page.get_static_site_paths` method (which returns a generator of URL paths for use by static site generator packages) has been removed. Packages relying on this functionality should provide their own fallback implementation.
