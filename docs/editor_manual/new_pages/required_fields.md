# Required fields

-   Fields marked with an asterisk are required. You will not be able to save a draft or submit the page for moderation without these fields being completed.
-   If you try to save/submit the page with some required fields not filled out, you will see the error displayed here.
-   The number of validation errors for each of the _Promote_ and _Content_ tabs will appear in a red circle, and the text, 'This field is required', will appear above each field that must be completed.

The Content and Promote tabs have a red "1" next to them, and the Title field is bordered in red with a "This field is required" message above](../../_static/images/screen23_validation_error.png)
