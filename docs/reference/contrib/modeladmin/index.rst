``ModelAdmin``
=====================

The ``modeladmin`` module allows you to add any model in your project to the Wagtail admin.  You can create customisable listing
pages for a model, including plain Django models, and add navigation elements so that a model can be accessed directly from the Wagtail admin. Simply extend the ``ModelAdmin`` class, override a few attributes to suit your needs, register it with Wagtail using an easy one-line ``modeladmin_register`` method (you can copy and paste from the examples below), and you're good to go. Your model doesn’t need to extend ``Page`` or be registered as a ``Snippet``, and it won’t interfere with any of the existing admin functionality that Wagtail provides.

.. _modeladmin_feature_summary:

-------------------
Summary of features
-------------------

- A customisable list view, allowing you to control what values are displayed
  for each row, available options for result filtering, default ordering, 
  spreadsheet downloads and more.
- Access your list views from the Wagtail admin menu easily with automatically
  generated menu items, with automatic 'active item' highlighting. Control the
  label text and icons used with easy-to-change attributes on your class.
- An additional ``ModelAdminGroup`` class, that allows you to group your
  related models, and list them together in their own submenu, for a more
  logical user experience.
- Simple, robust **add** and **edit** views for your non-Page models that use
  the panel configurations defined on your model using Wagtail's edit panels.
- For Page models, the system directs to Wagtail's existing add and
  edit views, and returns you back to the correct list page, for a seamless
  experience.
- Full respect for permissions assigned to your Wagtail users and groups. Users
  will only be able to do what you want them to!
- All you need to easily hook your ``ModelAdmin`` classes into Wagtail, taking
  care of URL registration, menu changes, and registering any missing model
  permissions, so that you can assign them to Groups.
- **Built to be customisable** - While ``modeladmin`` provides a solid
  experience out of the box, you can easily use your own templates, and the
  ``ModelAdmin`` class has a large number of methods that you can override or
  extend, allowing you to customise the behaviour to a greater degree.

.. _modeladmin_usage:

Installation
------------

Add ``wagtail.contrib.modeladmin`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'wagtail.contrib.modeladmin',
    ]

How to use
----------

.. _modeladmin_example_simple:

A simple example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say your website is for a local library. They have a model called
``Book`` that appears across the site in many places. You can define a normal
Django model for it, then use ModelAdmin to create a menu in Wagtail's admin
to create, view, and edit ``Book`` entries.

``models.py`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel
    from wagtail.images.edit_handlers import ImageChooserPanel

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        cover_photo = models.ForeignKey(
            'wagtailimages.Image',
            null=True, blank=True,
            on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
            related_name='+'
        )

        panels = [
            FieldPanel('title'),
            FieldPanel('author'),
            ImageChooserPanel('cover_photo')
        ]

.. tip::

    You can specify ``FieldPanels`` like ``ImageChooserPanel``, ``PageChooserPanel``,
    and ``DocumentChooserPanel`` within the ``panels`` attribute of the model.
    This lets you use Wagtail-specific features in an otherwise traditional
    Django model.


``wagtail_hooks.py`` in your app directory would look something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import (
        ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register)
    from .models import Book


    class BookAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = Book
        menu_label = 'Book'  # ditch this to use verbose_name_plural from model
        menu_icon = 'pilcrow'  # change as required
        menu_order = 200  # will put in 3rd place (000 being 1st, 100 2nd)
        add_to_settings_menu = False  # or True to add your model to the Settings sub-menu
        exclude_from_explorer = False # or True to exclude pages of this type from Wagtail's explorer view
        list_display = ('title', 'author')
        list_filter = ('author',)
        search_fields = ('title', 'author')

    # Now you just need to register your customised ModelAdmin class with Wagtail
    modeladmin_register(BookAdmin)


.. _modeladmin_example_complex:

A more complicated example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to ``Book``, perhaps we also want to add ``Author`` and ``Genre``
models to our app and display a menu item for each of them, too. Creating
lots of menus can add up quickly, so it might be a good idea to group related
menus together. This section show you how to create one menu called *Library*
which expands to show submenus for *Book*, *Author*, and *Genre*.

Assume we've defined ``Book``, ``Author``, and ``Genre`` models in
``models.py``.

``wagtail_hooks.py`` in your app directory would look something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import (
        ModelAdmin, ModelAdminGroup, modeladmin_register)
    from .models import (
        Book, Author, Genre)


    class BookAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = Book
        menu_label = 'Book'  # ditch this to use verbose_name_plural from model
        menu_icon = 'pilcrow'  # change as required
        list_display = ('title', 'author')
        list_filter = ('genre', 'author')
        search_fields = ('title', 'author')


    class AuthorAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = Author
        menu_label = 'Author'  # ditch this to use verbose_name_plural from model
        menu_icon = 'user'  # change as required
        list_display = ('first_name', 'last_name')
        list_filter = ('first_name', 'last_name')
        search_fields = ('first_name', 'last_name')


    class GenreAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = Genre
        menu_label = 'Genre'  # ditch this to use verbose_name_plural from model
        menu_icon = 'group'  # change as required
        list_display = ('name',)
        list_filter = ('name',)
        search_fields = ('name',)


    class LibraryGroup(ModelAdminGroup):
        menu_label = 'Library'
        menu_icon = 'folder-open-inverse'  # change as required
        menu_order = 200  # will put in 3rd place (000 being 1st, 100 2nd)
        items = (BookAdmin, AuthorAdmin, GenreAdmin)

    # When using a ModelAdminGroup class to group several ModelAdmin classes together,
    # you only need to register the ModelAdminGroup class with Wagtail:
    modeladmin_register(LibraryGroup)


.. _modeladmin_multi_registration:

Registering multiple classes in one ``wagtail_hooks.py`` file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each time you call ``modeladmin_register(MyAdmin)`` it creates a new top-level
menu item in Wagtail's left sidebar. You can call this multiple times within
the same ``wagtail_hooks.py`` file if you want. The example below will create
3 top-level menus.

.. code-block:: python

    class BookAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = Book
        ...

    class MovieAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        model = MovieModel
        ...

    class MusicAdminGroup(ModelAdminGroup):
        label = _("Music")
        items = (AlbumAdmin, ArtistAdmin)
        ...

    modeladmin_register(BookAdmin)
    modeladmin_register(MovieAdmin)
    modeladmin_register(MusicAdminGroup)
