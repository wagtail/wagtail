# Deploy your site

So far, you've been accessing your site locally. Now, it's time to deploy it. Deployment makes your site publicly accessible on the Internet by hosting it on a production server.

To deploy your site, you'll first need to choose a [hosting provider](deployment_guide), then follow their Wagtail deployment guide.

If you're unsure, we have a tutorial for using [Fly.io with Backblaze](../deployment/flyio).

Congratulations! You made it to the end of the tutorial!
