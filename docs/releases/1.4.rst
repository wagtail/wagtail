What's new
==========


Custom document models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Document` model can now be overridden using the new `WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_MODEL` setting. This works in the same way that `WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL` works for `Image`.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Custom page managers no longer raise an error when used on an abstract model
 * Wagtail's migrations are now all reversible (benjaoming)
 * Deleting a page content type now preserves existing pages as basic Page instances, to prevent tree corruption


Upgrade considerations
