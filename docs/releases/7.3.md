## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Loading of fixtures containing models referencing `Locale`

Previously, when loading fixtures of Page models or other models extending `TranslatableMixin`, missing `locale_id` values would be automatically filled with the default Locale. This could break the setup of TransactionTestCase, and so this functionality has now been removed. Fixtures must now specify an explicit `locale_id` value.
