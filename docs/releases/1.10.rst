Upgrade considerations
======================

Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 support dropped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 has been dropped in this release; please upgrade from these before upgrading Wagtail. Note that the Django 1.8 release series is still supported, as a Long Term Support release.


Signals on custom ``Image`` and ``Rendition`` models connected automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects using :ref:`custom image models <custom_image_model>` no longer need to set up signal receivers to handle deletion of image files and image feature detection, as these are now handled automatically by Wagtail. The following lines of code should be removed:

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete the source image file when an image is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Delete the rendition image file when a rendition is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomRendition)
    def rendition_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Perform image feature detection (if enabled)
    @receiver(pre_save, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_feature_detection(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        if not instance.has_focal_point():
            instance.set_focal_point(instance.get_suggested_focal_point())
