## What's new

### Custom validation support for StreamField

Support for adding custom validation logic to StreamField blocks has been formalised and simplified. For most purposes, raising a `ValidationError` from the block's `clean` method is now sufficient; more complex behaviours (such as attaching errors to a specific child block) are possible through block-specific subclasses of `ValidationError`. For more details, see [](streamfield_validation). This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

## Upgrade considerations

### Removal of deprecated features

The following features deprecated in Wagtail 3.0 have been fully removed. See [Wagtail 3.0 release notes](/releases/3.0) for details on these changes, including how to remove usage of these features:

* The modules `wagtail.core`, `wagtail.tests`, `wagtail.admin.edit_handlers` and `wagtail.contrib.forms.edit_handlers` are removed.
* The field panel classes `StreamFieldPanel`, `RichTextFieldPanel`, `ImageChooserPanel`, `DocumentChooserPanel` and `SnippetChooserPanel` are removed.
* StreamField definitions must include `use_json_field=True` (with the exception of migrations created prior to Wagtail 5.0).
* The `BASE_URL` setting is no longer recognised.
* The `ModelAdmin.get_form_fields_exclude` method is no longer passed a `request` argument.
* The `ModelAdmin.get_edit_handler` method is no longer passed a `request` or `instance` argument.
* The `widget_overrides`, `required_fields`, `required_formsets`, `bind_to`, `render_as_object` and `render_as_field` methods on `Panel` (previously `EditHandler`) are removed.

The following features deprecated in Wagtail 4.0 have been fully removed. See [Wagtail 4.0 release notes](/releases/4.0) for details on these changes, including how to remove usage of these features:

* The `wagtail.contrib.settings.models.BaseSetting` class is removed.
* The `Page.get_latest_revision_as_page` method is removed.
* The `page` and `page_id` properties and `as_page_object` method on `Revision` are removed.
* The JavaScript functions `createPageChooser`, `createSnippetChooser`, `createDocumentChooser` and `createImageChooser` are removed.
* The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.menus.SubMenu` class is removed.
* Subclasses of `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` are now required to accept a `base_url_path` keyword argument on the constructor.
* The `wagtail.admin.widgets.chooser.AdminChooser` class is removed.
* The `wagtail.snippets.views.snippets.get_snippet_edit_handler` function is removed.

### `Page.get_static_site_paths` method removed

The undocumented `Page.get_static_site_paths` method (which returns a generator of URL paths for use by static site generator packages) has been removed. Packages relying on this functionality should provide their own fallback implementation.

### `wagtailsearch.Query` has moved to `wagtail.contrib.search_promotions`

The `wagtailsearch.Query` model has been moved from the `search` application to the contrib application `wagtail.contrib.search_promotions`.
All imports will need to be updated and migrations will need to be run via a custom command, some imports will still work with a warning until a future version.

#### Migration command

If you have daily hits records in the `wagtailsearch.Query` you can run the management command to move these records to the new location.

```sh
./manage.py copy_daily_hits_from_wagtailsearch
```

#### Import updates

| **Import**    | **Old import**                               | **New import**                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Query` Model | `from wagtail.search.models import Query`    | `from wagtail.contrib.search_promotions.models import Query`    |
| `QueryForm`   | `from wagtail.search.forms import QueryForm` | `from wagtail.contrib.search_promotions.forms import QueryForm` |

### Changes to header CSS classes in `ModelAdmin` templates

If there are custom styles in place for the `ModelAdmin`'s header content or more complex [template overrides](modeladmin_overriding_templates) in us, there are a few changes for the following classes to be aware of.

| **Content**                      | **Old classes**       | **New classes** |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Heading & search (contains `h1`) | `.left.header-left`   | `.left`         |
| Action buttons (`header_extra`)  | `.right.header-right` | `.right`        |


### Slug field widget required for auto-formatting

The slug field JavaScript behaviour was previously attached to any field with an ID of `id_slug`, this has now changed to be any field with the appropriate HTML data attributes.

If using a custom edit handler or set of panels for page models, the correct widget will now need to be used for these data attributes to be included. This widget will use the `WAGTAIL_ALLOW_UNICODE_SLUGS` Django setting.

```python
from wagtail.admin.widgets.slug import SlugInput
# ... other imports

class MyPage(Page):
    promote_panels = [
        FieldPanel("slug", widget=SlugInput),
        # ... other panels
    ]
```

Additionally, the slug behaviour can be attached to any field easily by including the following attributes in HTML or via Django's widget `attrs`.

```html
<input type="text" name="slug" data-controller="w-slug" data-action="blur->w-slug#slugify" />
```

To allow unicode values, add the data attribute value;

```html
<input type="text" name="slug" data-controller="w-slug" data-action="blur->w-slug#slugify" data-w-slug-allow-unicode="true" />
```



### Progress button (`button-longrunning`) now implemented with Stimulus

The `button-longrunning` class usage has been updated to use the newly adopted Stimulus approach, the previous data attributes will be deprecated in a future release.

If using the old approach, ensure any HTML templates are updated to the new approach before the next major release.

#### Old syntax

```html+django
<button type="submit" class="button action-save button-longrunning" data-clicked-text="{% trans 'Creating…' %}">
  {% icon name="spinner" %}
  <em>{% trans 'Create' %}</em>
</button>
```

#### New syntax

Minimum required attributes are `data-controller` and a `data-action`.

```html+django
<button type="submit" class="button action-save button-longrunning" data-controller="w-progress" data-action="w-progress#activate" data-w-progress-active-value="{% trans 'Creating…' %}">
  {% icon name="spinner" %}
  <em data-w-progress-target="label">{% trans 'Create' %}</em>
</button>
```

#### Examples of additional capabilities

Stimulus [targets](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/targets) and [actions](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/actions) can be leveraged to revise the behaviour via data attributes.

* `<button ... data-w-progress-duration-value="500" ...>` - custom duration can be declared on the element
* `<button ... class="custom-button" data-w-progress-active-class="custom-button--busy" ...>` - custom 'active' class to replace the default `button-longrunning-active` (must be a single string without spaces)
* `<button ... ><strong data-w-progress-target="label">{% trans 'Create' %}</strong></button>` - any element can be the button label (not just `em`)
* `<button ... data-action="w-progress#activate focus->w-progress#activate" ...>` - any event can be used to trigger the in progress behaviour
* `<button ... data-action="w-progress#activate:once" ...>` - only trigger the progress behaviour once
* `<button ... data-action="readystatechange@document->w-progress#activate:once" data-w-progress-duration-value="5000" disabled ...>` - disabled on load (once JS starts) and becomes enabled after 5s duration


### Changes to StreamField `ValidationError` classes

The client-side handling of StreamField validation errors has been updated. The JavaScript classes `StreamBlockValidationError`, `ListBlockValidationError`, `StructBlockValidationError` and `TypedTableBlockValidationError` have been removed, and the corresponding Python classes can no longer be serialised using Telepath. Instead, the `setError` methods on client-side block objects now accept a plain JSON representation of the error, obtained from the `as_json_data` method on the Python class. Custom JavaScript code that works with these objects must be updated accordingly.

Additionally, the Python `StreamBlockValidationError`, `ListBlockValidationError`, `StructBlockValidationError` and `TypedTableBlockValidationError` classes no longer provide a `params` dict with `block_errors` and `non_block_errors` items; these are now available as the attributes `block_errors` and `non_block_errors` on the exception itself (or `cell_errors` and `non_block_errors` in the case of `TypedTableBlockValidationError`).
