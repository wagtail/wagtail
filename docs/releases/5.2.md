## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### `ModelViewSet` automatically registers the model to the reference index

Models that are registered with a `ModelViewSet` now have reference index tracking enabled by default. This means that you no longer need to call `ReferenceIndex.register_model()` in your app's `ready()` method for such models. If this is undesired, you can disable it by setting {attr}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.add_to_reference_index` to `False` on the `ModelViewSet` subclass. For more details, see [](managing_the_reference_index).

### Groups `IndexView.results_template_name` renamed from `results.html` to `index_results.html`

The `IndexView`'s `results_template_name` attribute in the `GroupViewSet` has been renamed from `wagtailusers/groups/results.html` to `wagtailusers/groups/index_results.html` for consistency with the other viewsets. If you have customised or extended the template, e.g. for [](customising_group_views), you will need to rename it to match the new name.
