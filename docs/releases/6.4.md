### Bug fixes

### Documentation

 * Move the [model reference page](../reference/models.md) from reference/pages to the references section as it covers all Wagtail core models (Srishti Jaiswal)
 * Move the [panels reference page](../reference/panels.md) from references/pages to the references section as panels are available for any model editing, merge panels API into this page (Srishti Jaiswal)
 * Move the tags documentation to standalone [advanced topic for tagging](../advanced_topics/tags.md), instead of being inside the reference/pages section (Srishti Jaiswal)
 * Refine the [](adding_reports) page so that common (page/non-page) class references are at the top and the full page only example has correct heading nesting (Alessandro Chitarrini)
 * Add the [`wagtail start`](wagtail_start) command to the management commands reference page (Damilola Oladele)
 * Refine the [](project_templates_reference) page sections and document common issues encountered when creating custom templates (Damilola Oladele)
 * Refine titles, references and URLS to better align with the documentation style guide, including US spelling (Srishti Jaiswal)

 * Improve code highlighting and formatting for Python docstrings in core models (Srishti Jaiswal)
 * Update all JavaScript inline scripts & some CSS inline style tags to a CSP compliant approach by using external scripts/styles (Aayushman Singh)
 * Update usage of `mark_safe` to `format_html` for any script inclusions, to better avoid XSS issues from example code (Aayushman Singh)
 * Update documentation writing guidelines to [encourage better considerations](documentation_code_example_considerations) of security, accessibility and good practice when writing code examples (Aayushman Singh, LB (Ben) Johnston)

### Maintenance

 * Close open files when reading within utils/setup.py (Ataf Fazledin Ahamed)
 * Avoid redundant `ALLOWED_HOSTS` check in `Site.find_for_request` (Jake Howard)
 * Update `CloneController` to ensure that `added`/`cleared` events are not dispatched as cancelable (LB (Ben) Johnston)
 * Remove unused `uuid` UMD module as all code is now using the NPM module (LB (Ben) Johnston)


## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` update

It's recommended that all projects set the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting to 10000 or higher.

This specifies the maximum number of fields allowed in a form submission, and it is recommended to increase this from Django's default of 1000, as particularly complex page models can exceed this limit within Wagtail's page editor:

```python
# settings.py
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 10_000
```
