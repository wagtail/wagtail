## Upgrade considerations

### `base_url_path` keyword argument added to AdminURLHelper

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` class now accepts a `base_url_path` keyword argument on its constructor. Custom subclasses of this class should be updated to accept this keyword argument.


### Dropped support for Safari 13

Safari 13 will no longer be officially supported as of this release, this deviates the current support for the last 3 version of Safari by a few months and was required to add better support for RTL languages.
