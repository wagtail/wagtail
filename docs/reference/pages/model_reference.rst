.. _page_model_ref:

``Page``
========

Database fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Page

    .. attribute:: title

        (text)

        Human-readable title of the page.

    .. attribute:: draft_title

        (text)

        Human-readable title of the page, incorporating any changes that have been made in a draft edit (in contrast to the ``title`` field, which for published pages will be the title as it exists in the current published version).

    .. attribute:: slug

        (text)

        This is used for constructing the page's URL.

        For example: ``http://domain.com/blog/[my-slug]/``

    .. attribute:: content_type

        (foreign key to ``django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType``)

        A foreign key to the :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType` object that represents the specific model of this page.

    .. attribute:: live

        (boolean)

        A boolean that is set to ``True`` if the page is published.

        Note: this field defaults to ``True`` meaning that any pages that are created programmatically will be published by default.

    .. attribute:: has_unpublished_changes

        (boolean)

        A boolean that is set to ``True`` when the page is either in draft or published with draft changes.

    .. attribute:: owner

        (foreign key to user model)

        A foreign key to the user that created the page.

    .. attribute:: first_published_at

        (date/time)

        The date/time when the page was first published.

    .. attribute:: last_published_at

        (date/time)

        The date/time when the page was last published.

    .. attribute:: seo_title

        (text)

        Alternate SEO-crafted title, for use in the page's ``<title>`` HTML tag.

    .. attribute:: search_description

        (text)

        SEO-crafted description of the content, used for search indexing. This is also suitable for the page's ``<meta name="description">`` HTML tag.

    .. attribute:: show_in_menus

        (boolean)

        Toggles whether the page should be included in site-wide menus, and is shown in the ``promote_panels`` within the Page editor.

        Wagtail does not include any menu implementation by default, which means that this field will not do anything in the front facing content unless built that way in a specific Wagtail installation.

        However, this is used by the :meth:`~wagtail.query.PageQuerySet.in_menu` QuerySet filter to make it easier to query for pages that use this field.

        Defaults to ``False`` and can be overridden on the model with ``show_in_menus_default = True``.

        .. note::

            To set the global default for all pages, set ``Page.show_in_menus_default = True`` once where you first import the ``Page`` model.

    .. attribute:: locked

        (boolean)

        When set to ``True``, the Wagtail editor will not allow any users to edit
        the content of the page.

        If ``locked_by`` is also set, only that user can edit the page.

    .. attribute:: locked_by

        (foreign key to user model)

        The user who has currently locked the page. Only this user can edit the page.

        If this is ``None`` when ``locked`` is ``True``, nobody can edit the page.

    .. attribute:: locked_at

        (date/time)

        The date/time when the page was locked.

    .. attribute:: alias_of

        (foreign key to another page)

        If set, this page is an alias of the page referenced in this field.

    .. attribute:: locale

        (foreign key to Locale)

        This foreign key links to the ``Locale`` object that represents the page language.

    .. attribute:: translation_key

        (uuid)

        A UUID that is shared between translations of a page. These are randomly generated
        when a new page is created and copied when a translation of a page is made.

        A translation_key value can only be used on one page in each locale.

    .. autoattribute:: localized

    .. autoattribute:: localized_draft

    .. attribute:: search_fields

        A list of fields to be indexed by the search engine. See Search docs :ref:`wagtailsearch_indexing_fields`

    .. attribute:: subpage_types

        A list of page models which can be created as children of this page type. For example, a ``BlogIndex`` page might allow a ``BlogPage`` as a child, but not a ``JobPage``:

        .. code-block:: python

            class BlogIndex(Page):
                subpage_types = ['mysite.BlogPage', 'mysite.BlogArchivePage']

        The creation of child pages can be blocked altogether for a given page by setting its subpage_types attribute to an empty array:

        .. code-block:: python

            class BlogPage(Page):
                subpage_types = []

    .. attribute:: parent_page_types

        A list of page models which are allowed as parent page types. For example, a ``BlogPage`` may only allow itself to be created below the ``BlogIndex`` page:

        .. code-block:: python

            class BlogPage(Page):
                parent_page_types = ['mysite.BlogIndexPage']

        Pages can block themselves from being created at all by setting parent_page_types to an empty array (this is useful for creating unique pages that should only be created once):

        .. code-block:: python

            class HiddenPage(Page):
                parent_page_types = []

        To allow for a page to be only created under the root page (for example for ``HomePage`` models) set the ``parent_page_type`` to ``['wagtailcore.Page']``.

        .. code-block:: python

            class HomePage(Page):
                parent_page_types = ['wagtailcore.Page']

    .. automethod:: can_exist_under

    .. automethod:: can_create_at

    .. automethod:: can_move_to

    .. automethod:: get_route_paths

    .. attribute:: password_required_template

        Defines which template file should be used to render the login form for Protected pages using this model. This overrides the default, defined using ``PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE`` in your settings. See :ref:`private_pages`

    .. attribute:: is_creatable

        Controls if this page can be created through the Wagtail administration. Defaults to ``True``, and is not inherited by subclasses. This is useful when using :ref:`multi-table inheritance <django:multi-table-inheritance>`, to stop the base model from being created as an actual page.

    .. attribute:: max_count

        Controls the maximum number of pages of this type that can be created through the Wagtail administration interface. This is useful when needing "allow at most 3 of these pages to exist", or for singleton pages.

    .. attribute:: max_count_per_parent

        Controls the maximum number of pages of this type that can be created under any one parent page.

    .. attribute:: exclude_fields_in_copy

        An array of field names that will not be included when a Page is copied.
        Useful when you have relations that do not use `ClusterableModel` or should not be copied.

        .. code-block:: python

            class BlogPage(Page):
                exclude_fields_in_copy = ['special_relation', 'custom_uuid']

        The following fields will always be excluded in a copy - `['id', 'path', 'depth', 'numchild', 'url_path', 'path']`.

    .. attribute:: base_form_class

        The form class used as a base for editing Pages of this type in the Wagtail page editor.
        This attribute can be set on a model to customise the Page editor form.
        Forms must be a subclass of :class:`~wagtail.admin.forms.WagtailAdminPageForm`.
        See :ref:`custom_edit_handler_forms` for more information.

.. _site-model-ref:

``Site``
========

The ``Site`` model is useful for multi-site installations as it allows an administrator to configure which part of the tree to use for each hostname that the server responds on.

The :meth:`~wagtail.models.Site.find_for_request` function returns the Site object that will handle the given HTTP request.


Database fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Site

    .. attribute:: hostname

        (text)

        This is the hostname of the site, excluding the scheme, port and path.

        For example: ``www.mysite.com``

        .. note::

            If you're looking for how to get the root url of a site, use the :attr:`~Site.root_url` attribute.

    .. attribute:: port

        (number)

        This is the port number that the site responds on.

    .. attribute:: site_name

        (text - optional)

        A human-readable name for the site. This is not used by Wagtail itself, but is suitable for use on the site front-end, such as in ``<title>`` elements.

        For example: ``Rod's World of Birds``

    .. attribute:: root_page

        (foreign key to :class:`~wagtail.models.Page`)

        This is a link to the root page of the site. This page will be what appears at the ``/`` URL on the site and would usually be a homepage.

    .. attribute:: is_default_site

        (boolean)

        This is set to ``True`` if the site is the default. Only one site can be the default.

        The default site is used as a fallback in situations where a site with the required hostname/port couldn't be found.

Methods and properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Site
    :noindex:

    .. automethod:: find_for_request

    .. autoattribute:: root_url

        This returns the URL of the site. It is calculated from the :attr:`~Site.hostname` and the :attr:`~Site.port` fields.

        The scheme part of the URL is calculated based on value of the :attr:`~Site.port` field:

        - 80 = ``http://``
        - 443 = ``https://``
        - Everything else will use the ``http://`` scheme and the port will be appended to the end of the hostname (for example ``http://mysite.com:8000/``)

    .. automethod:: get_site_root_paths


Locale
======

The ``Locale`` model defines the set of languages and/or locales that can be used on a site.
Each ``Locale`` record corresponds to a "language code" defined in the :ref:`wagtail_content_languages_setting` setting.

Wagtail will initially set up one ``Locale`` to act as the default language for all existing content.
This first locale will automatically pick the value from ``WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES`` that most closely matches the site primary language code defined in ``LANGUAGE_CODE``.
If the primary language code is changed later, Wagtail will **not** automatically create a new ``Locale`` record or update an existing one.

Before internationalisation is enabled, all pages use this primary ``Locale`` record.
This is to satisfy the database constraints, and makes it easier to switch internationalisation on at a later date.

Changing ``WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Languages can be added or removed from ``WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES`` over time.

Before removing an option from ``WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES``, it's important that the ``Locale``
record is updated to a use a different content language or is deleted.
Any ``Locale`` instances that have invalid content languages are automatically filtered out from all
database queries making them unable to be edited or viewed.

Methods and properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Locale
    :noindex:

    .. autoattribute:: language_code

    .. automethod:: get_default

    .. automethod:: get_active

    .. automethod:: get_display_name


Translatable Mixin
==================

``TranslatableMixin`` is an abstract model that can be added to any non-page Django model to make it translatable.
Pages already include this mixin, so there is no need to add it.

Methods and properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``locale`` and ``translation_key`` fields have a unique key constraint to prevent the object being translated into a language more than once.

.. class:: TranslatableMixin
    :noindex:

    .. attribute:: locale

        (Foreign Key to :class:`~wagtail.models.Locale`)

        For pages, this defaults to the locale of the parent page.

    .. attribute:: translation_key

        (uuid)

        A UUID that is randomly generated whenever a new model instance is created.
        This is shared with all translations of that instance so can be used for querying translations.

    .. automethod:: get_translations

    .. automethod:: get_translation

    .. automethod:: get_translation_or_none

    .. automethod:: has_translation

    .. automethod:: copy_for_translation

    .. automethod:: get_translation_model

    .. autoattribute:: localized


.. _revision_model_ref:

``Revision``
============

Every time a page is edited, a new ``Revision`` is created and saved to the database. It can be used to find the full history of all changes that have been made to a page and it also provides a place for new changes to be kept before going live.

- Revisions can be created from any :class:`~wagtail.models.Page` object by calling its :meth:`~Page.save_revision` method
- The content of the page is JSON-serialisable and stored in the :attr:`~Revision.content` field
- You can retrieve a ``Revision`` as a :class:`~wagtail.models.Page` object by calling the :meth:`~Revision.as_object` method

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

    The model has been renamed from ``PageRevision`` to ``Revision`` and it now references the ``Page`` model using a :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey`.

Database fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Revision

    .. attribute:: content_object

        (generic foreign key)

        This property returns the object this revision belongs to as an instance of the specific class.

    .. attribute:: content_type

        (foreign key to :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType`)

        This is the content type of the object this revision belongs to. For page revisions, this means the content type of the specific page type.

    .. attribute:: base_content_type

        (foreign key to :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType`)

        This is the base content type of the object this revision belongs to. For page revisions, this means the content type of the :class:`~wagtail.models.Page` model.

    .. attribute:: object_id

        (string)

        This represents the primary key of the object this revision belongs to.

    .. attribute:: submitted_for_moderation

        (boolean)

        ``True`` if this revision is in moderation

    .. attribute:: created_at

        (date/time)

        This is the time the revision was created

    .. attribute:: user

        (foreign key to user model)

        This links to the user that created the revision

    .. attribute:: content

        (dict)

        This field contains the JSON content for the page at the time the revision was created

        .. versionchanged:: 3.0

          The field has been renamed from ``content_json`` to ``content`` and it now uses :class:`~django.db.models.JSONField` instead of
          :class:`~django.db.models.TextField`.

Managers
~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Revision
    :noindex:

    .. attribute:: objects

        This default manager is used to retrieve all of the ``Revision`` objects in the database. It also provides a :meth:`~wagtail.models.RevisionsManager.for_instance` method that lets you query for revisions of a specific object.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            Revision.objects.all()
            Revision.objects.for_instance(my_object)

    .. attribute:: page_revisions

        This manager extends the default manager and is used to retrieve all of the ``Revision`` objects that belong to pages.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            Revision.page_revisions.all()

        .. versionadded:: 4.0

            This manager is added as a shorthand to retrieve page revisions.

    .. attribute:: submitted_revisions

        This manager extends the default manager and is used to retrieve all of the ``Revision`` objects that are awaiting moderator approval.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            Revision.submitted_revisions.all()

Methods and properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: Revision
    :noindex:

    .. automethod:: as_object

        This method retrieves this revision as an instance of its object's specific class. If the revision belongs to a page, it will be an instance of the :class:`~wagtail.models.Page`'s specific subclass.

        .. versionchanged:: 4.0

            This method has been renamed from ``as_page_object()`` to ``as_object()``.

    .. automethod:: approve_moderation

        Calling this on a revision that's in moderation will mark it as approved and publish it

    .. automethod:: reject_moderation

        Calling this on a revision that's in moderation will mark it as rejected

    .. automethod:: is_latest_revision

        Returns ``True`` if this revision is the object's latest revision

    .. automethod:: publish

        Calling this will copy the content of this revision into the live object. If the object is in draft, it will be published.

    .. autoattribute:: base_content_object

        This property returns the object this revision belongs to as an instance of the base class.
