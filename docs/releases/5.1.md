## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Other features

 * Mark calls to `md5` as not being used for secure purposes, to avoid flagging on FIPS-mode systems (Sean Kelly)
 * Return filters from `parse_query_string` as a `QueryDict` to support multiple values (Aman Pandey)

### Bug fixes

 * Prevent choosers from failing when initial value is an unrecognised ID, e.g. when moving a page from a location where `parent_page_types` would disallow it (Dan Braghis)

### Documentation

 * Document how to add non-ModelAdmin views to a `ModelAdminGroup` (Onno Timmerman)
 * Document how to add StructBlock data to a StreamField (Ramon Wenger)

### Maintenance

 * Switch to ruff for flake8 / isort code checking (Oliver Parker)
