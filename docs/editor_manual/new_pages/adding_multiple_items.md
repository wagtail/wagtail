-   Whenever you see the white cross in the green circle illustrated here, it means you can add multiple objects or items to a page. Clicking the icon will display the fields required for that piece of content. The image below demonstrates this with a _Related link_ item.

-   You can delete an individual item by pressing the trash can in the top-right.
