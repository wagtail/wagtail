What's new
==========

Protection against unsaved changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The page editor interface now produces a warning if the user attempts to navigate away while there are unsaved changes.


Multiple document uploader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Add a document" interface now supports uploading multiple documents at once, in the same way as uploading images.


Customisation of the page listing QuerySet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pages shown in the explorer can now be customised using a new hook called :ref:`construct_explorer_page_queryset <construct_explorer_page_queryset>`.


Custom document models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Document`` model can now be overridden using the new ``WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_MODEL`` setting. This works in the same way that ``WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL`` works for ``Image``.


Removed django-compressor dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail no longer depends on the `django-compressor <http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/>`_ library. While we highly recommend compressing and bundling the CSS and Javascript on your sites, using django-compressor places additional installation and configuration demands on the developer, so this has now been made optional.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Snippets now support a custom ``edit_handler`` property; this can be used to implement a tabbed interface, for example. See :ref:`customising_the_tabbed_interface` (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Date/time pickers now respect the locale's 'first day of week' setting (Peter Quade)
 * Refactored the way forms are constructed for the page editor, to allow custom forms to be used
 * Notification message on publish now indicates whether the page is being published now or scheduled for publication in future (Chris Rogers)
 * Server errors when uploading images / documents through the chooser modal are now reported back to the user (Nigel Fletton)
 * New translations for Hungarian, Swedish (Sweden) and Turkish


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Custom page managers no longer raise an error when used on an abstract model
 * Wagtail's migrations are now all reversible (benjaoming)
 * Deleting a page content type now preserves existing pages as basic Page instances, to prevent tree corruption
 * The ``Page.path`` field is now explicitly given the "C" collation on PostgreSQL to prevent tree ordering issues when using a database created with the Slovak locale
 * Wagtail's compiled static assets are now put into the correct directory on Windows (Aarni Koskela)
 * ``ChooserBlock`` now correctly handles models with primary keys other than ``id`` (alexpilot11)
 * Fixed typo in Wistia oEmbed pattern (Josh Hurd)
 * Added more accurate help text for the Administrator flag on user accounts (Matt Fozard)
 * Tags added on the multiple image uploader are now saved correctly
 * Documents created by a user are no longer deleted when the user is deleted
 * Fixed a crash in ``RedirectMiddleware`` when a middleware class before ``SiteMiddleware`` returns a response (Josh Schneier)
 * Fixed error retrieving the moderator list on pages that are covered by multiple moderator permission records (Matt Fozard)
 * Ordering pages in the explorer by reverse 'last updated' time now puts pages with no revisions at the top


Upgrade considerations
======================

Removal of django-compressor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As Wagtail no longer installs django-compressor automatically as a dependency, you may need to make changes to your site's configuration when upgrading. If your project is actively using django-compressor (that is, your site templates contain ``{% compress %}`` tags), you should ensure that your project's requirements explicitly include django-compressor, rather than indirectly relying on Wagtail to install it. If you are not actively using django-compressor on your site, you should update your settings file to remove the line ``'compressor'`` from ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and remove ``'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder'`` from ``STATICFILES_FINDERS``.
