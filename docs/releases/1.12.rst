Wagtail 1.12 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 8 months). Please note that Wagtail 1.12 will be the last LTS release to support Python 2.


What's new
==========

Configurable rich text features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The feature set provided by the rich text editor can now be configured on a per-field basis, by passing a ``features`` keyword argument; for example, a field can be configured to allow bold / italic formatting and links, but not headings or embedded images or media. For further information, see :ref:`rich_text_features`. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

Improved embed configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New configuration options for embedded media have been added, to give greater control over how media URLs are converted to embeds, and to make it possible to specify additional media providers beyond the ones built in to Wagtail. For further information, see :ref:`embedded_content`. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The admin interface now displays a title of the latest draft (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Added multi-select form field to the form builder (dwasyl)
 * Improved performance of sitemap generation (Levi Adler)
 * StreamField now respects the ``blank`` setting; StreamBlock accepts a ``required`` setting (Loic Teixeira)
 * StreamBlock now accepts ``min_num``, ``max_num`` and ``block_counts`` settings to control the minimum and maximum numbers of blocks (Edwar Baron, Matt Westcott)
 * Users can no longer remove their own active / superuser flags through Settings -> Users (Stein Strindhaug, Huub Bouma)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * FieldBlocks in StreamField now call the field's ``prepare_value`` method (Tim Heap)
 * Initial disabled state of InlinePanel add button is now set correctly on non-default tabs (Matthew Downey)
 * Redirects with unicode characters now work (Rich Brennan)
 * Prevent explorer view from crashing when page model definitions are missing, allowing the offending pages to be deleted (Matt Westcott)
 * Hide the userbar from printed page representation (Eugene Morozov)
 * Prevent the page editor footer content from collapsing into two lines unnecessarily (Jack Paine)
 * StructBlock values no longer render HTML templates as their ``str`` representation, to prevent infinite loops in debugging / logging tools (Matt Westcott)

Upgrade considerations
======================

StreamField now defaults to ``blank=False`` 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

StreamField now respects the ``blank`` field setting; when this is false, at least one block must be supplied for the field to pass validation. To match the behaviour of other model fields, ``blank`` defaults to ``False``; if you wish to allow a StreamField to be left empty, you must now add ``blank=True`` to the field.


Old configuration settings for embeds are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration settings ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBED_FINDER`` and ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBEDLY_KEY`` have been deprecated in favour of the new ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_FINDERS`` setting. Please see :ref:`configuring_embed_finders` for the new configuration to use.

Registering custom hallo.js plugins directly is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ability to enable / disable ``hallo.js`` plugins by calling ``registerHalloPlugin`` or modifying the ``halloPlugins`` list has been deprecated, and will be removed in Wagtail 1.14. The recommended way of customising the hallo.js editor is now through :ref:`rich text features <rich_text_features>`. For details of how to define a hallo.js plugin as a rich text feature, see :ref:`extending_wysiwyg`.
