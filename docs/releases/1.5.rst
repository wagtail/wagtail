What's new
==========

Reorganised page explorer actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_static/images/releasenotes_1_5_explorermenu.png

The action buttons on the page explorer have been reorganised to reduce clutter, and lesser-used actions have been moved to a "More" dropdown. A new hook :ref:`register_page_listing_buttons` has been added for adding custom action buttons to the page explorer.

ModelAdmin
~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now includes an app ``wagtail.contrib.modeladmin`` (previously available separately as the `wagtailmodeladmin <https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmodeladmin>`_ package) which allows you to configure arbitrary Django models to be listed, added and edited through the Wagtail admin.

See :doc:`/reference/contrib/modeladmin/index` for full documentation. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.


TableBlock
~~~~~~~~~~

``TableBlock``, a new StreamField block type for editing table-based content, is now available through the ``wagtail.contrib.table_block`` module.

.. image:: ../_static/images/screen40_table_block.png

See :doc:`/reference/contrib/table_block` for documentation. This feature was developed by Moritz Pfeiffer, David Seddon and Brad Busenius.


Improved link handling in rich text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_static/images/releasenotes_1_5_unlink.gif

The user experience around inserting, editing and removing links inside rich text areas has been greatly improved: link destinations are shown as tooltips, and existing links can be edited as well as unlinked. This feature was developed by Loic Teixeira.


Improvements to the "Image serve view"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`using_images_outside_wagtail`

This view, which is used for requesting image thumbnails from an external app, has had some improvements made to it in this release.

- A :ref:`"redirect" action <image_serve_view_redirect_action>` has been added which will redirect the user to where the resized image is hosted rather than serving it from the app. This may be beneficial for performance if the images are hosted externally (eg, S3)
- It now takes an optional extra path component which can be used for appending a filename to the end of the URL
- The key is now configurable on the view so you don't have to use your project's ``SECRET_KEY``
- It's been refactored into a class based view and you can now create multiple serve views with different image models and/or keys
- It now supports :ref:`serving image files using django-sendfile <image_serve_view_sendfile>` (Thanks to Yannick Chabbert for implementing this)

Upgrade considerations
======================

Buttons in admin now require ``class="button"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Wagtail admin CSS has been refactored for maintainability, and buttons now require an explicit ``button`` class. (Previously, the styles were applied on all inputs of type ``"submit"``, ``"reset"`` or ``"button"``.) If you have created any apps that extend the Wagtail admin with new views / templates, you will need to add this class to all buttons.


The ``search_fields`` attribute on models should now be set to a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On searchable models (eg, ``Page`` or custom ``Image`` models) the ``search_fields`` attribute should now be a list instead of a tuple.

For example, the following ``Page`` model:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + (
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        )

Should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        ]

To ease the burden on third-party modules, adding tuples to ``Page.search_fields`` will still work. But this backwards-compatibility fix will be removed in Wagtail 1.7.

Elasticsearch backend now defaults to verifying SSL certs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, if you used the Elasticsearch backend, configured with the URLS property like:


.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch',
            'URLS': ['https://example.com/'],
        }
    }

Elasticsearch would not be configured to verify SSL certificates for HTTPS URLs. This has been changed so that SSL certificates are verified for HTTPS connections by default.

If you need the old behaviour back, where SSL certificates are not verified for your HTTPS connection, you can configure the Elasticsearch backend with the ``HOSTS`` option, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch',
            'HOSTS': [{
                'host': 'example.com'
                'use_ssl': True,
                'verify_certs': False,
            }],
        }
    }

See the `Elasticsearch-py documentation <http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/stable/#ssl-and-authentication>`_ for more configuration options.


Project template now imports ``settings.dev`` explicitly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous releases, the project template's ``settings/__init__.py`` file was set up to import the development settings (``settings/dev.py``), so that these would be picked up as the default (i.e. whenever a settings module was not specified explicitly). However, in some setups this meant that the development settings were being inadvertently imported in production mode.

For this reason, the import in ``settings/__init__.py`` has now been removed, and commands must now specify ``myproject.settings.dev`` or ``myproject.settings.production`` as appropriate; the supporting scripts (such as ``manage.py``) have been updated accordingly. As this is a change to the project template, existing projects are not affected; however, if you have any common scripts or configuration files that rely on importing ``myproject.settings`` as the settings module, these will need to be updated in order to work on projects created under Wagtail 1.5.
