## What's new

### Site setting permissions

The [](../reference/contrib/settings) app now allows permission over site settings to be granted on a per-site basis. This makes it possible to give non-superuser accounts full control over the configuration of an individual site. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

### Previews support for generic and site settings

The [](../reference/contrib/settings) app now allows previews to be enabled for generic and site setting models through `PreviewableMixin`. This makes it possible to preview your site while editing the settings. For more details, see [](enabling_previews_for_settings). This feature was developed by SÃ©bastien Corbin and Sage Abdullah.

### Media listings improvements

Image listings now support both grid and list layouts, with a simple toggle for users to switch between the two. The list layout gives you more information about the images, such as the file name, collection, creation date, and usage count. This helps CMS users manage larger collections of images, and makes it possible to display more metadata about images in the future.

The documents listing now also display the usage count for each document, making it easier to see which documents are being used on your site.

Thank you to Joel William for implementing this as part of the [Google Summer of Code program](https://wagtail.org/blog/four-contributors-for-gsoc-2025/), with support from Coen van der Kamp, Sage Abdullah, Thibaud Colas, Ben Enright.

### Collapsible StructBlock for block settings

To make it easier to navigate complex structured content, blocks created with `StructBlock` can now be collapsed and expanded like other structured block types. A common need for this is block settings, where the block supports a lot of optional fields:

```python
class BlockQuote(StructBlock):
    text = TextBlock()
    attribute_name = CharBlock(blank=True, required=False, label="e.g. Mary Berry")
    # Fields within the settings block will be available but hidden by default.
    settings = ThemeSettingsBlock(collapsed=True)
```

For more information, see [](custom_editing_interfaces_for_structblock) and [](streamfield_block_reference). This feature was implemented by Sage Abdullah, with support from the Wagtail UI team.

### Preview and user bar improvements for headless setups

The live preview and user bar features have been refactored and improved to work better in headless setups. The preview panel can now load a cross-domain headless frontend (provided by the wagtail-headless-preview package). The Wagtail user bar has been refactored into a template component, allowing it to be rendered independently and loaded by the headless frontend. Incorporating the user bar into the frontend enables features in the page editor, such as:

-   Live preview scroll restoration
-   Accessibility checks
-   Content metrics (word count, reading time)

For more details, see the documentation on [enabling the user bar](headless_user_bar) and [accessibility checker](headless_accessibility_checker) in headless setups. This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

### Documentation for admin UI components

Wagtailâ€™s developer documentation now includes [experimental docs to reuse admin UI components](javascript_components).
This new documentation helps developers reuse existing components when creating customizations or extensions of the admin interface, so those customizations are simpler to build and maintain.
The **documentation is experimental**, as well as reuse of those UI components. This means a component's API may change in a minor release without going through the deprecation process. If you use these components in your own code, please ensure that you have a testing process in place to catch any breaking changes with each Wagtail upgrade.

This feature was implemented by Sage Abdullah, with support from the Wagtail UI team.

### Keyboard shortcuts improvements

The admin interface now supports more keyboard shortcuts to facilitate common actions: in this release, toggling the main navigation sidebar, and the minimap within the page editor.
Itâ€™s also now possible for users to disable all of Wagtailâ€™s custom shortcuts via a dedicated setting in their user profile.

Thank you to Dhruvi Patel for implementing this as part of the [Google Summer of Code program](https://wagtail.org/blog/four-contributors-for-gsoc-2025/), with support from Scott Cranfill, Thibaud Colas, LB (Ben) Johnston.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Deprecation of `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton`

The `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton` classes have been deprecated in favour of the generic `ListingButton` and `Button` classes.

The `PageListingButton` class was previously documented as part of the [`register_page_listing_buttons`](register_page_listing_buttons) hook. If you used this hook to add buttons to the page listing, you should now replace `wagtail.admin.widgets.PageListingButton` with `wagtail.admin.widgets.ListingButton`. Using the `PageListingButton` class will continue to work for now, but will raise a deprecation warning.

The `SnippetListingButton` and `UserListingButton` classes were previously documented as part of the [`register_snippet_listing_buttons`](register_snippet_listing_buttons) and [`register_user_listing_buttons`](register_user_listing_buttons) hooks, respectively. If you used these hooks to add buttons to the snippet or user listing, you should now replace `wagtail.snippets.widgets.SnippetListingButton` and `wagtail.users.widgets.UserListingButton` with one of the following:

-   Use `wagtail.admin.widgets.Button` if you want the button to appear as an item inside the "More" actions dropdown in the listing.
-   Use `wagtail.admin.widgets.ListingButton` if you want the button to appear as a top-level button in the listing.

Using the `SnippetListingButton` or `UserListingButton` classes will continue to work for now, but will raise a deprecation warning.

The `PageListingButton`, `SnippetListingButton`, and `UserListingButton` classes will be removed in a future release.

### Using `ListingButton` in `IndexView.get_list_more_buttons` now renders the button as a top-level button

If you have overridden the undocumented `get_list_more_buttons` method on a generic `IndexView` subclass (e.g. for a `ModelViewSet`) and used the `ListingButton` class to add buttons to the "More" actions dropdown, these buttons will now be rendered as top-level buttons in the listing. If you want the buttons to appear inside the "More" actions dropdown, you should use the `Button` class instead.

### `init_new_page` moved to `wagtail.signals`

The [](init_new_page_signal) signal, previously defined in `wagtail.admin.signals`, has now been moved to `wagtail.signals`. Any import lines referencing the old location need to be updated.

### `AccessibilityItem` now accepts an `in_editor` argument

The `AccessibilityItem` user bar item now accepts an {attr}`~wagtail.admin.userbar.AccessibilityItem.in_editor` argument, which is set to `True` when it is instantiated within the page editor. If you [customized the accessibility checker](built_in_accessibility_checker), you should update your code to pass this argument when creating an instance of your `AccessibilityItem` subclass.

```diff
 @hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
 def replace_userbar_accessibility_item(request, items, page):
     items[:] = [
-        CustomAccessibilityItem()
+        CustomAccessibilityItem(in_editor=item.in_editor)
         if isinstance(item, AccessibilityItem) else item
         for item in items
     ]
```

If you do not update your code, the `AccessibilityItem` will continue to work, but the `in_editor` argument will always be `False`. Wagtail does not currently use this argument, but it may do so in the future. It may also be utilized by users for [cross-domain headless setups](headless_accessibility_checker).

### `wagtail.telepath` and `wagtail.widget_adapters` moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath`

The `wagtail.telepath` module has now been moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath`, and `wagtail.widget_adapters` has been moved to `wagtail.admin.telepath.widgets`. Any import lines referencing the old locations need to be updated.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### List view for image listings

The `wagtailimages` listing view templates have been adapted to support both list and grid layout. Those adaptations should be replicated for any overrides or reuse of those templates.

### Removal of `wagtailadmin/js/telepath/telepath.js`

The JavaScript file `wagtailadmin/js/telepath/telepath.js` is no longer required, as Telepath initialization is now handled within `wagtailadmin/js/core.js`. Any templates used within the Wagtail admin should remove imports of this file; any front-end code using Telepath outside of the Wagtail admin should use the `telepath.js` supplied with [the `telepath` package](https://wagtail.github.io/telepath/) or [`telepath-unpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telepath-unpack).

### Rewrite of Tabs component frontend

The frontend implementation of the Tabs component (used in `TabbedInterface` and elsewhere) has been rewritten using Stimulus.

Any existing usage of the component via the `data-tabs` attribute will no longer work. Here is a summary of the new approach.

These are subject to change and are still not officially documented, please add a thumbs up or comment to [the feature request](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/8408) if you would like a formalised Python or JavaScript API for the Tabs component.
