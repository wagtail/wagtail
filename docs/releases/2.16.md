## What's new

### Django 4.0 support

This release adds support for Django 4.0.

### Slim sidebar

As part of a [wider redesign](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/7739) of Wagtail’s administration interface, we have replaced the sidebar with a slim, keyboard-friendly version. This re-implementation comes with significant accessibility improvements for keyboard and screen reader users, and will enable us to make navigation between views much snappier in the future. Please have a look at [upgrade considerations](2.16_upgrade_considerations) for more details on differences with the previous version.

### Automatic redirect creation

Wagtail projects using the `wagtail.contrib.redirects` app now benefit from 'automatic redirect creation' - which creates redirects for pages and their descedants whenever a URL-impacting change is made; such as a slug being changed, or a page being moved to a different part of the tree.

This feature should be benefitial to most 'standard' Wagtail projects and, in most cases, will have only a minor impact on responsiveness when making such changes. However, if you find this feature is not a good fit for your project, you can disabled it by adding the following to your project settings:

```python
WAGTAILREDIRECTS_AUTO_CREATE = False
```

Thank you to [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) for kindly sponsoring this feature.

(2.16_upgrade_considerations)=

## Upgrade considerations

### Removed support for Django 3.0 and 3.1

Django 3.0 and 3.1 are no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Django 3.2 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### Removed support for Python 3.6

Python 3.6 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.7 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### StreamField ListBlock now returns `ListValue` rather than a list instance

The data type returned as the value of a ListBlock is now a custom class, `ListValue`, rather than a Python `list` object. This change allows it to provide a `bound_blocks` property that exposes the list items as [`BoundBlock` objects](../advanced_topics/boundblocks_and_values) rather than plain values. `ListValue` objects are mutable sequences that behave similarly to lists, and so all code that iterates over them, accesses individual elements, or manipulates them should continue to work. However, code that specifically expects a `list` object (e.g. using `isinstance` or testing for equality against a list) may need to be updated. For example, a unit test that tests the value of a `ListBlock` as follows:

```python
    self.assertEqual(page.body[0].value, ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```

should be rewritten as:

```python
    self.assertEqual(list(page.body[0].value), ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```

### Change to `set` method on tag fields

This release upgrades the [django-taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to 2.x, which introduces one breaking change: the `TaggableManager.set` method now accepts a list of tags as a single argument, rather than a variable number of arguments. Code such as `page.tags.set('red', 'blue')` should be updated to `page.tags.set(['red', 'blue'])`.

### `wagtail.admin.views.generic.DeleteView` follows Django 4.0 conventions

The internal (undocumented) class-based view `wagtail.admin.views.generic.DeleteView` has been updated to align with [Django 4.0's `DeleteView` implementation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/4.0/#deleteview-changes), which uses `FormMixin` to handle POST requests. Any custom deletion logic in `delete()` handlers should be moved to `form_valid()`.

### Renamed admin/expanding-formset.js

`admin/expanding_formset.js` has been renamed to `admin/expanding-formset.js` as part of frontend code clean up work. Check for any customised admin views that are extending expanding formsets, or have overridden template and copied the previous file name used in an import as these may need updating.

### Deprecated sidebar capabilities

The new sidebar largely supports the same customisations as its predecessor, with a few exceptions:

- Top-level menu items should now always provide an `icon_name`, so they can be visually distinguished when the sidebar is collapsed.
- `MenuItem` and its sub-classes no longer supports customising arbitrary HTML attributes.
- `MenuItem` can no longer be sub-classed to customise its HTML output or load additional JavaScript

For sites relying on those capabilities, we provide a `WAGTAIL_SLIM_SIDEBAR = False` setting to switch back to the legacy sidebar. The legacy sidebar and this setting will be removed in Wagtail 2.18.
