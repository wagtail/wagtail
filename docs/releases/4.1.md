Wagtail 4.1 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).

## What's new

### New UI for scheduled publishing

Scheduled publishing settings can now be found within the Status side panel of the page editing view. This change aims to improve clarity over who is able to set schedules, and when they take effect. This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

### Customisable snippet admin views

The `register_snippet` function now accepts a `SnippetViewSet` class, allowing various aspects of the snippet's admin views to be customised. See [](wagtailsnippets_custom_admin_views). This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

### Scheduled publishing for snippets

Snippet models that inherit from `DraftStateMixin` can now be assigned go-live and expiry dates. This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

### Object usage reporting

Images, documents and snippets now provide a usage report, listing the places where references to those objects appear.  This report is powered by a new `ReferenceIndex` model which records cross-references between objects whenever those objects to save; this allows it to work more efficiently than the old report available through the `WAGTAIL_USAGE_COUNT_ENABLED` setting, as well as handling references within StreamField and rich text fields.

Note that on first upgrading to Wagtail 4.1, you will need to run the `rebuild_references_index` management command to populate the references table and ensure that reference counts are displayed accurately.

This feature was developed by Karl Hobley and Matt Westcott.

## Upgrade considerations

### `rebuild_references_index` management command

After upgrading, you will need to run `./manage.py rebuild_references_index` in order to populate the references table and ensure that usage counts for images, documents and snippets are displayed accurately.

### Button styling class changes

The `button-secondary` class is no longer compatible with either the `.serious` or `.no` classes, this partially worked previously but is no longer officially supported.

When adding custom buttons using the `ModelAdmin` `ButtonHelper` class, custom buttons will no longer include the `button-secondary` class by default in index listings.

If using the hook `register_user_listing_buttons` to register buttons along with the undocumented `UserListingButton` class, the `button-secondary` class will no longer be included by default.

Avoid using `disabled` as a class on `button` elements, instead use the [`disabled` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) as support for this as a class may be removed in a future version of Wagtail and is not accessible.

If using custom `expanding-formset` the add button will no longer support the `disabled` class but instead must require the `disabled` attribute to be set.

The following button classes have been removed, none of which were being used within the admin but may have been used by custom code or packages:

* `button-neutral`
* `button-strokeonhover`
* `hover-no`
* `unbutton`
* `yes`

### Dropped support for importing `.xls` Spreadsheet files into Redirects

* `.xls` legacy Microsoft Excel 97-2003 spreadsheets will no longer be supported for importing into the contrib Redirects listing.
* `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.tsv` formats are still supported.
