Extending Wagtail
=================

The Wagtail admin interface is a suite of Django apps, and so the familiar concepts from Django development - views, templates, URL routes and so on - can be used to add new functionality to Wagtail. Numerous `third-party packages <https://wagtail.org/packages/>`_ can be installed to extend Wagtail's capabilities.

This section describes the various mechanisms that can be used to integrate your own code into Wagtail's admin interface.
