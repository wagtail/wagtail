*Starting with 0.17.22 only Python 3.7+ is supported. The 0.17 series is
also the last to support old PyYAML functions, replace it by creating a*
`YAML()` *instance and use its* `.load()` *and* `.dump()` *methods.*
**New(er) functionality is usually only available via the new API.**

The 0.17.21 was the last one tested to be working on Python 3.5 and 3.6
(the latter was not tested, because tox/virtualenv stopped supporting
that EOL version). The 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to
be working on Python 2.7.

*Please adjust/pin your dependencies accordingly if necessary.*
(`ruamel.yaml<0.18`)

There are now two extra plug-in packages
(`ruamel.yaml.bytes` and `ruamel.yaml.string`)
for those not wanting to do the streaming to a
`io.BytesIO/StringIO` buffer themselves.

If your package uses `ruamel.yaml` and is not listed on PyPI, drop me an
email, preferably with some information on how you use the package (or a
link to the repository) and I'll keep you informed when the status of
the API is stable enough to make the transition.

# ChangeLog

0.17.40 (2023-10-20):

- flow style sets are now preserved ( `!!set {a, b, c} )`. Any values specified when loading are dropped, including `!!null ""`.
- potential workaround for issue 484: the long_description_content_type including the variant specification `CommonMark`
can result in problems on Azure. If you can install from `.tar.gz` using
`RUAMEL_NO_LONG_DESCRIPTION=1 pip install ruamel.yaml --no-binary :all:` then the long description, and its
offending type, are nog included (in the METADATA). 
(Reported by [Coury Ditch](https://sourceforge.net/u/cmditch/profile/))

- links in documentation update (reported by [David Hoese](https://sourceforge.net/u/daveydave400/profile/))
- Added some `__repr__` for internally used classes

0.17.39 (2023-10-19):

- update README generation, no code changes

0.17.36 (2023-10-19):

- fixed issue 480, dumping of a loaded empty flow-style mapping with comment failed (Reported by [Stéphane Brunner](https://sourceforge.net/u/stbrunner/profile/))
- fixed issue 482, caused by DEFAULT_MAPPING_TAG having changes to being a `Tag()` instance, not a string (reported by [yan12125](https://sourceforge.net/u/yan12125/profile/))
- updated documentation to use mkdocs

0.17.35 (2023-10-04):

- support for loading dataclasses with `InitVar` variables (some special coding was necessary to get the, unexecpected, default value in the corresponding instance attribute ( example of usage in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/77228378/1307905))

0.17.34 (2023-10-03):

- Python 3.12 also loads C version when using `typ='safe'`
- initial support for loading invoking
`__post_init__()` on dataclasses that have that
method after loading a registered dataclass.

```
@yaml.register_class
@dataclass

```

0.17.33 (2023-09-28):

- added `flow_seq_start`, `flow_seq_end`, `flow_seq_separator`, `flow_map_start`, `flow_map_end`, `flow_map_separator` **class** attributes to the `Emitter` class so flow style output can more easily be influenced (based on [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76547814/1307905) on a StackOverflow question by [Huw Walters](https://stackoverflow.com/users/291033/huw-walters)).

0.17.32 (2023-06-17):

- fix issue with scanner getting stuck in infinite loop

0.17.31 (2023-05-31):

- added tag.setter on `ScalarEvent` and on `Node`, that takes either a `Tag` instance, or a str (reported by [Sorin Sbarnea](https://sourceforge.net/u/ssbarnea/profile/))

0.17.30 (2023-05-30):

- fix issue 467, caused by Tag instances not being hashable (reported by [Douglas Raillard](https://bitbucket.org/%7Bcf052d92-a278-4339-9aa8-de41923bb556%7D/))

0.17.29 (2023-05-30):

- changed the internals of the tag property from a string to a class which allows for preservation of the original handle and suffix. This should result in better results using documents with %TAG directives, as well as preserving URI escapes in tag suffixes.

0.17.28 (2023-05-26):

- fix for issue 464: documents ending with document end marker
without final newline fail to load (reported by [Mariusz
Rusiniak](https://sourceforge.net/u/r2dan/profile/))

0.17.27 (2023-05-25):

- fix issue with inline mappings as value for merge keys (reported by Sirish on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/76331049/1307905))
- fix for 468, error inserting after accessing merge attribute on `CommentedMap` (reported by [Bastien gerard](https://sourceforge.net/u/bagerard/))
- fix for issue 461 pop + insert on same `CommentedMap` key throwing error (reported by [John Thorvald Wodder II](https://sourceforge.net/u/jwodder/profile/))

0.17.26 (2023-05-09):

- fix for error on edge cage for issue 459

0.17.25 (2023-05-09):

- fix for regression while dumping wrapped strings with too many backslashes removed (issue 459, reported by [Lele Gaifax](https://sourceforge.net/u/lele/profile/))

0.17.24 (2023-05-06):

- rewrite of `CommentedMap.insert()`. If you have a merge key in the YAML document for the mapping you insert to, the position value should be the one as you look at the YAML input. This fixes issue 453 where other keys of a merged in mapping would show up after an insert (reported by [Alex Miller](https://sourceforge.net/u/millerdevel/profile/)). It also fixes a call to `.insert()` resulting into the merge key to move to be the first key if it wasn't already and it is also now possible to insert a key before a merge key (even if the fist key in the mapping).
- fix (in the pure Python implementation including default) for issue 447. (reported by [Jack Cherng](https://sourceforge.net/u/jfcherng/profile/), also brought up by brent on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/40072485/1307905))

0.17.23 (2023-05-05):

- fix 458, error on plain scalars starting with word longer than width. (reported by [Kyle Larose](https://sourceforge.net/u/klarose/profile/))
- fix for `.update()` no longer correctly handling keyword arguments (reported by John Lin on [StackOverflow]( https://stackoverflow.com/q/76089100/1307905))
- fix issue 454: high Unicode (emojis) in quoted strings always
escaped (reported by [Michal
Čihař](https://sourceforge.net/u/nijel/profile/) based on a
question on StackOverflow).
- fix issue with emitter conservatively inserting extra backslashes in wrapped quoted strings (reported by thebenman on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/75631454/1307905))

0.17.22 (2023-05-02):

- fix issue 449 where the second exclamation marks got URL encoded (reported and fixing PR provided by [John Stark](https://sourceforge.net/u/jods/profile/))
- fix issue with indent != 2 and literal scalars with empty first line (reported by wrdis on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/75584262/1307905))
- updated `__repr__` of CommentedMap, now that Python's dict is ordered -> no more `ordereddict(list-of-tuples)`
- merge MR 4, handling OctalInt in YAML 1.1 (provided by [Jacob Floyd](https://sourceforge.net/u/cognifloyd/profile/))
- fix loading of `!!float 42` (reported by Eric on [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71555107/1307905))
- line numbers are now set on `CommentedKeySeq` and `CommentedKeyMap` (which are created if you have a sequence resp. mapping as the key in a mapping)
- plain scalars: put single words longer than width on a line of
their own, instead of after the previous line (issue 427, reported
by [Antoine
Cotten](https://sourceforge.net/u/antoineco/profile/)). Caveat:
this currently results in a space ending the previous line.
- fix for folded scalar part of 421: comments after ">" on first
line of folded scalars are now preserved (as were those in the
same position on literal scalars). Issue reported by Jacob Floyd.
- added stacklevel to warnings
- typing changed from Py2 compatible comments to Py3, removed various Py2-isms

0.17.3 (2021-04-07):

- fix for issue 382 caused by an error in a format string (reported by [William Kimball](https://sourceforge.net/u/william303/))
- allow expansion of aliases by setting `yaml.composer.return_alias = lambda s: copy.deepcopy(s)`
(as per [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66983530/1307905))

0.17.2 (2021-03-29):

- change -py2.py3-none-any.whl to -py3-none-any.whl, and remove 0.17.1

0.17.1 (2021-03-29):

- added 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only', and
removing 0.17.0 from PyPI (reported by [Alasdair

Use the methods on `YAML()`, which have been extended.
- fix for issue 376: indentation changes could put literal/folded
scalar to start before the `#` column of a following comment.
Effectively making the comment part of the scalar in the output.
(reported by [Bence Nagy](https://sourceforge.net/u/underyx/))

0.16.13 (2021-03-05):
