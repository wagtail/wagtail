Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* It is no longer possible to have the explorer and settings menu open at the same time
* Page IDs in page revisions were not updated on page copy, causing subsequent edits to be committed to the original page instead
* Copying a page now creates a new page revision, ensuring that changes to the title/slug are correctly reflected in the editor (and also ensuring that the user performing the copy is logged)
* Prevent a race condition when creating Filter objects
* On adding a new page, the available page types are ordered by the displayed verbose name
