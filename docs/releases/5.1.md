## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Other features

 * Mark calls to `md5` as not being used for secure purposes, to avoid flagging on FIPS-mode systems (Sean Kelly)
 * Return filters from `parse_query_string` as a `QueryDict` to support multiple values (Aman Pandey)
 * Explicitly specify `MenuItem.name` for all admin menu and submenu items (Justin Koestinger)

### Bug fixes

 * Prevent choosers from failing when initial value is an unrecognised ID, e.g. when moving a page from a location where `parent_page_types` would disallow it (Dan Braghis)
 * Move comment notifications toggle to the comments side panel (Sage Abdullah)
 * Remove comment button on InlinePanel fields (Sage Abdullah)
 * Fix missing link to `UsageView` from `EditView` for snippets (Christer Jensen)
 * Prevent lowercase conversions of IndexView column headers (Virag Jain)
 * Ensure that `RichText` objects with the same values compare as equal (NikilTn)

### Documentation

 * Document how to add non-ModelAdmin views to a `ModelAdminGroup` (Onno Timmerman)
 * Document how to add StructBlock data to a StreamField (Ramon Wenger)
 * Update ReadTheDocs settings to v2 to resolve urllib3 issue in linkcheck extension (Thibaud Colas)
 * Update documentation for `log_action` parameter on `RevisionMixin.save_revision` (Christer Jensen)
 * Reorganise snippets documentation to cover customisations and optional features (Sage Abdullah)
 * Update color customisations guidance to include theme-agnostic options (Thibaud Colas)

### Maintenance

 * Switch to ruff for flake8 / isort code checking (Oliver Parker)
 * Deprecate `insert_editor_css` in favour of `insert_global_admin_css` (Ester Beltrami)
 * Optimise use of `specific` on Task and TaskState (Matt Westcott)
 * Use table UI component for workflow task index view (Matt Westcott)
 * Make header search available on generic index view (Matt Westcott)
 * Update pagination behaviour to reject out-of-range / invalid page numbers (Matt Westcott)
 * Remove color tokens which are duplicates / unused (Thibaud Colas)
 * Add tests to help with maintenance of theme color tokens (Thibaud Colas)


## Upgrade considerations

### `insert_editor_css` hook is deprecated

The `insert_editor_css` hook has been deprecated. The `insert_global_admin_css` hook has the same functionality, and all uses of `insert_editor_css` should be changed to `insert_global_admin_css`.
