Wagtail 2.7 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).


What's new
==========

Improved StreamField design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_static/images/releasenotes_2_7_streamfield_styles.png

The design of the StreamField user interface has been updated to improve clarity and usability, including better handling of nested blocks. This work was completed by Bertrand Bordage as part of the `Wagtail's First Hatch <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noripyt/wagtails-first-hatch>`_ crowdfunding campaign. We would like to thank all `supporters of the campaign <https://wagtail.io/blog/wagtails-first-hatch-backers/>`_.


WebP image support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images can now be uploaded and rendered in `WebP <https://developers.google.com/speed/webp>`_ format; see :ref:`image_file_formats` for details. This feature was developed by frmdstryr, Karl Hobley and Matt Westcott.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Query strings added to static file URLs within the admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid problems caused by outdated cached JavaScript / CSS files following a Wagtail upgrade, URLs to static files within the Wagtail admin now include a version-specific query parameter of the form ``?v=1a2b3c4d``. Under certain front-end cache configurations (such as `Cloudflare's 'No Query String' caching level <https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168256-What-are-Cloudflare-s-caching-levels->`_), the presence of this parameter may prevent the file from being cached at all. If you are using such a setup, and have some other method in place to expire outdated files (e.g. clearing the cache on deployment), you can disable the query parameter by setting ``WAGTAILADMIN_STATIC_FILE_VERSION_STRINGS`` to False in your project settings. (Note that this is automatically disabled when ``ManifestStaticFilesStorage`` is in use.)


``Page.dummy_request`` is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal ``Page.dummy_request`` method (which generates an HTTP request object simulating a real page request, for use in previews) has been deprecated, as it did not correctly handle errors generated during middleware processing. Any code that calls this method to render page previews should be updated to use the new method ``Page.make_preview_request(original_request=None, preview_mode=None)``, which builds the request and calls ``Page.serve_preview`` as a single operation.


Changes to document serving on remote storage backends (Amazon S3 etc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a new setting :ref:`WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD <wagtaildocs_serve_method>` to control how document downloads are served. On previous versions of Wagtail, document files would always be served through a Django view, to allow permission checks to be applied. When using a remote storage backend such as Amazon S3, this meant that the document would be downloaded to the Django server on every download request.

In Wagtail 2.7, the default behaviour on remote storage backends is to redirect to the storage's underlying URL after performing the permission check. If this is unsuitable for your project (for example, your storage provider is configured to block public access, or revealing its URL would be a security risk) you can revert to the previous behaviour by setting ``WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD`` to ``'serve_view'``.


Template change for page action menu hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When customising the action menu on the page edit view through the :ref:`register_page_action_menu_item <register_page_action_menu_item>` or :ref:`construct_page_action_menu <construct_page_action_menu>` hook, the ``ActionMenuItem`` object's ``template`` attribute or ``render_html`` method can be overridden to customise the menu item's HTML. As of Wagtail 2.7, the HTML returned from these should *not* include the enclosing ``<li>`` element.

Any add-on library that uses this feature and needs to preserve backward compatibility with previous Wagtail versions can conditionally reinsert the ``<li>`` wrapper through its ``render_html`` method - for example:

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.html import format_html
    from wagtail import VERSION as WAGTAIL_VERSION
    from wagtail.admin.action_menu import ActionMenuItem

    class CustomMenuItem(ActionMenuItem):
        template = 'myapp/my_menu_item.html'

        def render_html(self, request, parent_context):
            html = super().render_html(request, parent_context)
            if WAGTAIL_VERSION < (2, 7):
                html = format_html('<li>{}</li>', html)
            return html



``wagtail.admin.utils`` and ``wagtail.admin.decorators`` modules deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modules ``wagtail.admin.utils`` and ``wagtail.admin.decorators`` have been deprecated. The helper functions defined here exist primarily for Wagtail's internal use; however, some of them (particularly ``send_mail`` and ``permission_required``) may be found in user code, and import lines will need to be updated. The new locations for these definitions are as follows:
