The Wagtail demo site
_____________________

This examples in this document are based on the `Wagtail demo site <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo/>`_. However, the instructions are general enough as to be applicable to any Wagtail site. If you want to use the demo site you can find installation and launch instructions on its `Github <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo/>`_ page.

For the purposes of this documentation we will be using the URL, **www.example.com**, to represent the root (homepage) of your website.
