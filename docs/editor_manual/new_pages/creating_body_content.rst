Creating page body content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The majority of the body content within a page will be created within text fields.

There are two types of text entry fields you will see when creating a page. Some, like *Page title* are basic text fields come with no formatting options. This is because all titles display the same across a single page type. Others, *Body* for example, require more formatting, and so a set of tools are provided for this purpose. These are referred to as rich text fields. 

So, when you click into certain fields, for example the *Body* field, you will be presented with a set of tools which allow you to format and style your text. These tools also allow you to insert links, images, videos clips and links to documents.
