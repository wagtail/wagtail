# Wagtail API

The API module provides a public-facing, JSON-formatted API to allow retrieving
content as raw field data. This is useful for cases like serving content to
non-web clients (such as a mobile phone app) or pulling content out of Wagtail
for use in another site.

See [RFC 8: Wagtail API](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/blob/main/text/008-wagtail-api.md#12---stable-and-unstable-versions)
for full details on our stabilisation policy.
