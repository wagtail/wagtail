## What's new

### StreamField data migration helpers

Wagtail now provides a set of utilities for creating data migrations on StreamField data. For more information, see [StreamField data migrations](streamfield_data_migrations). This feature was developed by Sandil Ranasinghe, initially as the [wagtail-streamfield-migration-toolkit](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-streamfield-migration-toolkit) add-on package, as part of the Google Summer of Code 2022 initiative, with support from Jacob Topp-Mugglestone, Joshua Munn and Karl Hobley.

### Locking for snippets

Snippets can now be locked by users to prevent other users from editing, through the use of the `LockableMixin`. For more details, see [](wagtailsnippets_locking_snippets).

This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

### `fullpageurl` template tag

Wagtail now provides a `fullpageurl` template tag (for both Django templates and Jinja2) to output a page's full URL including the domain. For more details, see [](fullpageurl_tag).

This feature was developed by Jake Howard.

## Upgrade considerations

### Wagtail-specific image field (`WagtailImageField`)

The `AbstractImage` and `AbstractRendition` models use a Wagtail-specific `WagtailImageField` which extends Django's `ImageField`
to use [Willow](https://github.com/wagtail/Willow/) for image file handling. This will generate a new migration if you
are using a [custom image model](custom_image_model)

### Comments within `InlinePanel` not supported

When the commenting system was introduced, support for `InlinePanel` fields was incorrectly added. This has lead to issues
where comments can be lost on save or in most cases will be added to the incorrect item within the `InlinePanel`. The ability
to add comments here has now been removed and as such any existing comments that were added will no longer show.

See https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/9685 for tracking of adding this back officially in the future.

### Adoption of `classname` convention for some template tags & includes

Some undocumented Wagtail admin template tags and includes have been refactored to adopt a more consistent naming of `classname`.

If these are used within packages or customisations they will need to be updated to the new variable naming convention.

| Name                | New (`classname`)                                                                                      | Old (various)                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dialog_toggle`     | `{% dialog_toggle classname='...' %}`                                                                  | `{% dialog_toggle class_name='...' %}`                                                               |
| `paginate`          | `{% paginate pages classname="..." %}`                                                                 | `{% paginate pages classnames="..." %}`                                                              |
| `tab_nav_link`      | `{% include 'wagtailadmin/shared/tabs/tab_nav_link.html' with classname="..." %}`                      | `{% include 'wagtailadmin/shared/tabs/tab_nav_link.html' with classes="..." %}`                      |
| `side_panel_button` | `{% include 'wagtailadmin/shared/side_panels/includes/side_panel_button.html' with classname="..." %}` | `{% include 'wagtailadmin/shared/side_panels/includes/side_panel_button.html' with classes="..." %}` |

### `InlinePanel` JavaScript function is now a class

The (internal, undocumented) `InlinePanel` JavaScript function, used to initialise client-side behaviour for inline panels, has been converted to a class. Any user code that calls this function should now replace `InlinePanel(...)` calls with `new InlinePanel(...)`. Additionally, child form controls are now initialised automatically, and so it is no longer necessary to call `initChildControls`, `updateChildCount`, `updateMoveButtonDisabledStates` or `updateAddButtonState`.

Python code that uses the `InlinePanel` panel type is not affected by this change.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_PAGE_EDIT_LOCK` setting is now `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_EDIT_LOCK`

The `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_PAGE_EDIT_LOCK` setting has been renamed to [`WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_EDIT_LOCK`](wagtailadmin_global_edit_lock).

### Wagtail userbar as a web component

The [`wagtailuserbar`](wagtailuserbar_tag) template tag now initialises the userbar as a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), with a `wagtail-userbar` custom element using shadow DOM to apply styles without any collisions with the host page.

For any site customising the position of the userbar, target the styles to `wagtail-userbar::part(userbar)` instead of `.wagtail-userbar`. For example:

```css
wagtail-userbar::part(userbar) {
    bottom: 30px;
}
```

### Support for legacy versions of `azure-mgmt-cdn` and `azure-mgmt-frontdoor` packages will be dropped

If you are using the front-end cache invalidator module (`wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache`) with Azure CDN or Azure Front Door, the following packages need to be updated:

* For Azure CDN: upgrade `azure-mgmt-cdn` to version 10 or above
* For Azure Front Door: upgrade `azure-mgmt-frontdoor` to version 1 or above

Support for older versions will be dropped in a future release.
