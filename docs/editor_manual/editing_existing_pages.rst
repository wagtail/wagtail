Editing existing pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is how you can access the edit screen of an existing page:

* Clicking the title of the page in an :doc:`Explorer page <finding_your_way_around/the_explorer_page>` or in :doc:`search results <finding_your_way_around/using_search>`.
* Clicking the *Edit* link below the title in either of the situations above.
* Clicking the *Edit* icon for a page in the explorer menu.

* When editing an existing page the title of the page being edited is displayed at the top of the page.
* The current status of the page is displayed in the top-right.
* You can change the title of the page by clicking into the title field.
* When you are typing into a field, help text is often displayed on the right-hand side of the screen.
