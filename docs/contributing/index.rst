Contributing to Wagtail
=======================

Issues
~~~~~~

The easiest way to contribute to Wagtail is to tell us how to improve it! First, check to see if your bug or feature request has already been submitted at `github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues>`_. If it has, and you have some supporting information which may help us deal with it, comment on the existing issue. If not, please `create a new one <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues/new>`_, providing as much relevant context as possible. For example, if you're experiencing problems with installation, detail your environment and the steps you've already taken. If something isn't displaying correctly, tell us what browser you're using, and include a screenshot if possible.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a Python or Django developer, `fork <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/>`_ and get stuck in! Send us a useful pull request and we'll post you a `t-shirt <https://twitter.com/WagtailCMS/status/432166799464210432/photo/1>`_. We welcome all contributions, whether they solve problems which are specific to you or they address existing issues. If you're stuck for ideas, pick something from the `issue list <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues?state=open>`_, or email us directly on `hello@wagtail.io <mailto:hello@wagtail.io>`_ if you'd like us to suggest something!


Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail has internationalisation support so if you are fluent in a non-English language you can contribute by localising the interface.

Translation work should be submitted through `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wagtail/>`_.

If you're not familiar with Github or pull requests, `contact us directly <mailto:hello@wagtail.io>`_ and we'll work something out.
