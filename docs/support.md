# Support

If you have any problems or questions about working with Wagtail, you are invited to visit any of the following support channels, where volunteer members of the Wagtail community will be happy to assist.

**Please respect the time and effort of volunteers, by not asking the same question in multiple places.** At best, you'll be spamming the same set of people each time; at worst, you'll waste the effort of volunteers who spend time answering a question unaware that it has already been answered elsewhere. If you absolutely must ask a question on multiple forums, post it on Stack Overflow first and include the Stack Overflow link in your subsequent posts.

## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wagtail) is the best place to find answers to your questions about working with Wagtail - there is an active community of Wagtail users and developers responding to questions there. When posting questions, please read Stack Overflow's advice on [how to ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and remember to tag your question with "wagtail".

## Mailing list

For topics and discussions that do not fit Stack Overflow's question-and-answer format, there is a Wagtail Support mailing list at [groups.google.com/d/forum/wagtail](https://groups.google.com/g/wagtail).

## Slack

The Wagtail Slack workspace is open to all users and developers of Wagtail. To join, head to: [https://wagtail.org/slack/](https://wagtail.org/slack/)

Please use the **#support** channel for support questions. Support is provided by members of the Wagtail community on a voluntary basis, and we cannot guarantee that questions will be answered quickly (or at all). If you want to see this resource succeed, please consider sticking around to help out! Also, please keep in mind that many of Wagtail's core and expert developers prefer to handle support queries on a non-realtime basis through Stack Overflow, and questions asked there may well get a better response.

## GitHub discussions

Our [Github discussion boards](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions) are open for sharing ideas and plans for the Wagtail project.

## Issues
