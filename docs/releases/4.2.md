## Upgrade considerations

### Wagtail-specific image field (`WagtailImageField`)

The `AbstractImage` and `AbstractRendition` models use a Wagtail-specific `WagtailImageField` which extends Django's `ImageField` 
to use [Willow](https://github.com/wagtail/Willow/) for image file handling. This will generate a new migration if you 
are using a [custom image model](custom_image_model)
