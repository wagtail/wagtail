Upgrade considerations
======================

SiteMiddleware moved to ``wagtail.contrib.legacy``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SiteMiddleware class (which provides the ``request.site`` property, and has been deprecated since Wagtail 2.9) has been moved to the ``wagtail.contrib.legacy`` namespace. On projects where this is still in use, the ``'wagtail.core.middleware.SiteMiddleware'`` entry in ``MIDDLEWARE`` should be changed to ``'wagtail.contrib.legacy.sitemiddleware.SiteMiddleware'``.


Run fixtree to prevent Collection creation issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Wagtail's Collections feature to organise images, documents or other media, please ensure
you run the following command in each environment:

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py fixtree --full

Previously, collections were stored in the order in which they were created - and then sorted by name where displayed in the CMS. Collections are now ordered by treebeard path by default, so the above command must be run to retain alphabetical ordering.

Failure to do this won't affect your current colllections, but may affect your ability to add new ones.
