Upgrade considerations
======================

Image format ``image_to_html`` method has been updated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal API for rich text image format objects (see :ref:`rich_text_image_formats`) has been updated; the ``Format.image_to_html`` method now receives the ``extra_attributes`` keyword argument as a dictionary of attributes, rather than a string. If you have defined any custom format objects that override this method, these will need to be updated.
