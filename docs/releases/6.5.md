## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `Page.save()` no longer automatically calls `full_clean` for draft pages

In previous releases, the `save()` method on page models called the `full_clean` method to apply [model-level validation rules](inv:django#validating-objects), regardless of whether the page was in a draft or live state, unless this was explicitly disabled by passing `clean=False`. As of this release, saving a page in a draft state (`live=False`) will only perform the minimum validation necessary to ensure data integrity: the title must be non-empty, and the slug must be unique within the parent page. Saving a page with `live=True` will apply full validation as before. If you have user code that creates draft pages and requires them to be validated, you must now call `full_clean` explicitly.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### `TAG_LIMIT` and `TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` settings renamed to `WAGTAIL_TAG_LIMIT` and `WAGTAIL_TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED`

The `TAG_LIMIT` and `TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` settings have been renamed to `WAGTAIL_TAG_LIMIT` and `WAGTAIL_TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED` respectively. The old settings will continue to work for now, but will be removed in a future release.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Removal of `insert_editor_js` hook output in some non-editor views

The `insert_editor_js` was historically added to some non editing views, these have now been removed.

The confirm bulk move view and the chooser modal view for choosing the new location of bulk move pages will no longer use the hook output `insert_editor_js`. If custom JavaScript is needed in these views, migrate to the documented [](insert_global_admin_js) hook instead.

The `insert_editor_js` hook will continue to be output when editing pages, as documented.

### Deprecation of `wagtail/admin/templates/wagtailadmin/pages/_editor_js.html` template

If your project overrides the undocumented template partial `wagtail/admin/templates/wagtailadmin/pages/_editor_js.html` to inject custom JavaScript into the Wagtail admin, this template will be removed in a future release.

Instead, follow the documented approaches to either use the [](insert_editor_js) hook or the [](insert_global_admin_js) hook.
