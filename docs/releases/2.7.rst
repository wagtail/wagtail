Wagtail 2.7 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).


What's new
==========

Improved StreamField design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_static/images/releasenotes_2_7_streamfield_styles.png

The design of the StreamField user interface has been updated to improve clarity and usability, including better handling of nested blocks. This work was completed by Bertrand Bordage as part of the `Wagtail's First Hatch <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noripyt/wagtails-first-hatch>`_ crowdfunding campaign. We would like to thank all `supporters of the campaign <https://wagtail.io/blog/wagtails-first-hatch-backers/>`_.

Upgrade considerations
======================

``Page.dummy_request`` is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal ``Page.dummy_request`` method (which generates an HTTP request object simulating a real page request, for use in previews) has been deprecated, as it did not correctly handle errors generated during middleware processing. Any code that calls this method to render page previews should be updated to use the new method ``Page.make_preview_request(original_request=None, preview_mode=None)``, which builds the request and calls ``Page.serve_preview`` as a single operation.


Changes to document serving on remote storage backends (Amazon S3 etc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a new setting :ref:`WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD <wagtaildocs_serve_method>` to control how document downloads are served. On previous versions of Wagtail, document files would always be served through a Django view, to allow permission checks to be applied. When using a remote storage backend such as Amazon S3, this meant that the document would be downloaded to the Django server on every download request.

In Wagtail 2.7, the default behaviour on remote storage backends is to redirect to the storage's underlying URL after performing the permission check. If this is unsuitable for your project (for example, your storage provider is configured to block public access, or revealing its URL would be a security risk) you can revert to the previous behaviour by setting ``WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD`` to ``'serve_view'``.


``wagtail.admin.utils`` and ``wagtail.admin.decorators`` modules deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modules ``wagtail.admin.utils`` and ``wagtail.admin.decorators`` have been deprecated. The helper functions defined here exist primarily for Wagtail's internal use; however, some of them (particularly ``send_mail`` and ``permission_required``) may be found in user code, and import lines will need to be updated. The new locations for these definitions are as follows:
