What's new
==========


New page privacy options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously users with publishing permissions were able to restrict access to a page based on a shared password. Now they can also restrict access to logged-in users only, or to users from specific groups. This feature was developed by Shawn Makinson, Tom Miller, Luca Perico and Matt Westcott.

See: :ref:`private_pages`


Restrictions on bulk-deletion of pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, any user with edit permission over a page and its descendants was able to delete them all as a single action, which led to the risk of accidental deletions. To guard against this, the permission rules have been revised so that a user with basic permissions can only delete pages that have no children; in order to delete a whole subtree, they must individually delete each child page first. A new "bulk delete" permission type has been added which allows a user to delete pages with children, as before; superusers receive this permission implicitly, and so there is no change of behaviour for them.

See: :ref:`permissions`

This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

Upgrade considerations
======================

``wagtail.wagtailimages.models.get_image_model`` has moved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``get_image_model`` function should now be imported from ``wagtail.wagtailimages`` rather than ``wagtail.wagtailimages.models``. See :ref:`custom_image_model_referring_to_image_model`.


Non-administrators now need 'bulk delete' permission to delete pages with children
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a precaution against accidental data loss, this release introduces a new "bulk delete" permission on pages, which can be set through the Settings -> Groups area. Non-administrator users must have this permission in order to delete pages that have children; a user without this permission would have to delete each child individually before deleting the parent. By default, no groups are assigned this new permission. If you wish to restore the previous behaviour, and don't want to configure permissions manually through the admin interface, you can do so with a data migration. Create an empty migration using ``./manage.py makemigrations myapp --empty --name assign_bulk_delete_permission`` (replacing ``myapp`` with the name of one of your project's apps) and edit the migration file to contain the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import unicode_literals

    from django.db import migrations


    def add_bulk_delete_permission(apps, schema_editor):
        """Find all groups with add/edit page permissions, and assign them bulk_delete permission"""
        GroupPagePermission = apps.get_model('wagtailcore', 'GroupPagePermission')
        for group_id, page_id in GroupPagePermission.objects.filter(
            permission_type__in=['add', 'edit']
        ).values_list('group', 'page').distinct():
            GroupPagePermission.objects.create(
                group_id=group_id, page_id=page_id, permission_type='bulk_delete'
            )


    def remove_bulk_delete_permission(apps, schema_editor):
        GroupPagePermission = apps.get_model('wagtailcore', 'GroupPagePermission')
        GroupPagePermission.objects.filter(permission_type='bulk_delete').delete()


    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        dependencies = [
            # keep the original dependencies line
        ]

        operations = [
            migrations.RunPython(add_bulk_delete_permission, remove_bulk_delete_permission),
        ]


Cloudflare cache module now requires a ``ZONEID`` setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``wagtail.contrib.wagtailfrontendcache.backends.CloudflareBackend`` module has been updated to use Cloudflare's v4 API, replacing the previous v1 implementation (which is `unsupported as of November 9th, 2016 <https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api/>`_). The new API requires users to supply a *zone identifier*, which should be passed as the ``ZONEID`` field of the ``WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE`` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
        'cloudflare': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.wagtailfrontendcache.backends.CloudflareBackend',
            'EMAIL': 'your-cloudflare-email-address@example.com',
            'TOKEN': 'your cloudflare api token',
            'ZONEID': 'your cloudflare domain zone id',
        },
    }

For details of how to obtain the zone identifier, see `the Cloudflare API documentation <https://api.cloudflare.com/#getting-started-resource-ids>`_.
