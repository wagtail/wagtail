# `modeladmin` customisation primer

The `modeladmin` app is designed to offer you as much flexibility as possible in how your model and its objects are represented in Wagtail's CMS. This page aims to provide you with some background information to help you gain a better understanding of what the app can do, and to point you in the right direction, depending on the kind of customisations you're looking to make.

## Wagtail's `ModelAdmin` class isn't the same as Django's

Wagtail's `ModelAdmin` class is designed to be used in a similar way to Django's class of the same name, and it often uses the same attribute and method names to achieve similar things. However, there are a few key differences:

### Add & edit forms are still defined by `panels` and `edit_handlers`

In Wagtail, controlling which fields appear in add/edit forms for your `Model`, and defining how they are grouped and ordered, is achieved by adding a `panels` attribute, or `edit_handler` to your `Model` class. This remains the same whether your model is a `Page` type, a snippet, or just a standard Django `Model`. Because of this, Wagtail's `ModelAdmin` class is mostly concerned with 'listing' configuration. For example, `list_display`, `list_filter` and `search_fields` attributes are present and support largely the same values as Django's ModelAdmin class, while `fields`, `fieldsets`, `exclude` and other attributes you may be used to using to configure Django's add/edit views, simply aren't supported by Wagtail's version.

### 'Page type' models need to be treated differently from other models

While `modeladmin`'s listing view and it's supported customisation options work in exactly the same way for all types of `Model`, when it comes to the other management views, the treatment differs depending on whether your ModelAdmin class is representing a page type model (that extends `wagtailcore.models.Page`) or not.

Pages in Wagtail have some unique properties, and require additional views, interface elements and general treatment in order to be managed effectively. For example, they have a tree structure that must be preserved properly as pages are added, deleted and moved around. They also have a revisions system, their own permission considerations, and the facility to preview changes before saving changes. Because of this added complexity, Wagtail provides its own specific views for managing any custom page types you might add to your project (whether you create a `ModelAdmin` class
for them or not).

In order to deliver a consistent user experience, `modeladmin` simply redirects users to Wagtail's existing page management views wherever possible. You should bear this in mind if you ever find yourself wanting to change what happens when pages of a certain type are added, deleted, published, or have some other action applied to them. Customising the `CreateView` or `EditView` for your page type `Model` (even if just to add an additional stylesheet or JavaScript), simply won't have any effect, as those views are not used.

If you do find yourself needing to customise the add, edit or other behaviour for a page type model, you should take a look at the following part of the documentation: [](admin_hooks).

### Wagtail's `ModelAdmin` class is 'modular'

Unlike Django's class of the same name, wagtailadmin's `ModelAdmin` acts primarily as a 'controller' class. While it does have a set of attributes and methods to enable you to configure how various components should treat your model, it has been deliberately designed to do as little work as possible by itself; it designates all of the real work to a set of
separate, swappable components.

The theory is: If you want to do something differently, or add some functionality that `modeladmin` doesn't already have, you can create new classes (or extend the ones provided by `modeladmin`) and easily configure your `ModelAdmin` class to use them instead of the defaults.

## Changing what appears in the listing

You should familiarise yourself with the attributes and methods supported by the `ModelAdmin` class, that allow you to change what is displayed in the `IndexView`. The following page should give you everything you need to get going: [](indexview)

(modeladmin_adding_css_and_js)=

## Adding additional stylesheets and/or JavaScript

The `ModelAdmin` class provides several attributes to enable you to easily add additional stylesheets and JavaScript to the admin interface for your model. Each attribute simply needs to be a list of paths to the files you want to include. If the path is for a file in your project's static directory, then Wagtail will automatically prepend the path with `STATIC_URL` so that you don't need to repeat it each time in your list of paths.

If you'd like to add styles or scripts to the `IndexView`, you should set the following attributes:

-   `index_view_extra_css` - Where each item is the path name of a pre-compiled stylesheet that you'd like to include.

-   `index_view_extra_js` - Where each item is the path name of a JavaScript file that you'd like to include.

If you'd like to do the same for `CreateView` and `EditView`, you should set the following attributes:

-   `form_view_extra_css` - Where each item is the path name of a pre-compiled stylesheet that you'd like to include.

-   `form_view_extra_js` - Where each item is the path name of a JavaScript file that you'd like to include.

And if you're using the `InspectView` for your model, and want to do the same for that view, you should set the following attributes:

-   `inspect_view_extra_css` - Where each item is the path name of a pre-compiled stylesheet that you'd like to include.

-   `inspect_view_extra_js` - Where each item is the path name of a JavaScript file that you'd like to include.

(modeladmin_overriding_templates)=

## Overriding templates

For all modeladmin views, Wagtail looks for templates in the following folders within your project or app, before resorting to the defaults:

1. `templates/modeladmin/app-name/model-name/`
2. `templates/modeladmin/app-name/`
3. `templates/modeladmin/`

So, to override the template used by `IndexView` for example, you'd create a new `index.html` template and put it in one of those locations. For example, if you wanted to do this for an `ArticlePage` model in a `news` app, you'd add your custom template as `news/templates/modeladmin/news/articlepage/index.html`.

For reference, `modeladmin` looks for templates with the following names for each view:

-   `'index.html'` for `IndexView`
-   `'inspect.html'` for `InspectView`
-   `'create.html'` for `CreateView`
-   `'edit.html'` for `EditView`
-   `'delete.html'` for `DeleteView`
-   `'choose_parent.html'` for `ChooseParentView`

To add extra information to a block within one of the above Wagtail templates, use Django's `{{ block.super }}` within the `{% block ... %}` that you wish to extend. For example, if you wish to display an image in an edit form below the fields of the model that is being edited, you could do the following:

```html+django
{% extends "modeladmin/edit.html" %}
{% load static %}

{% block content %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <div>
        <img src="{% get_media_prefix %}{{ instance.image }}"/>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
```

If for any reason you'd rather bypass the above behaviour and explicitly specify a template for a specific view, you can set either of the following attributes on your `ModelAdmin` class:

-   `index_template_name` to specify a template for `IndexView`
-   `inspect_template_name` to specify a template for `InspectView`
-   `create_template_name` to specify a template for `CreateView`
-   `edit_template_name` to specify a template for `EditView`
-   `delete_template_name` to specify a template for `DeleteView`
-   `choose_parent_template_name` to specify a template for `ChooseParentView`

(modeladmin_overriding_views)=

## Overriding views

For all of the views offered by `ModelAdmin`, the class provides an attribute that you can override in order to tell it which class you'd like to use:

-   `index_view_class`
-   `inspect_view_class`
-   `create_view_class` (not used for 'page type' models)
-   `edit_view_class` (not used for 'page type' models)
-   `delete_view_class` (not used for 'page type' models)
-   `choose_parent_view_class` (only used for 'page type' models)

For example, if you'd like to create your own view class and use it for the `IndexView`, you would do the following:

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import IndexView
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin
from .models import MyModel

class MyCustomIndexView(IndexView):
    # New functionality and existing method overrides added here
    ...


class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    index_view_class = MyCustomIndexView
```

Or, if you have no need for any of `IndexView`'s existing functionality in your view and would rather create your own view from scratch, `modeladmin` will support that too. However, it's highly recommended that you use `modeladmin.views.WMABaseView` as a base for your view. It'll make integrating with your `ModelAdmin` class much easier and will provide a bunch of useful attributes and methods to get you started.

You can also use the url_helper to easily reverse URLs for any ModelAdmin see [](modeladmin_reversing_urls).

(modeladmin_overriding_helper_classes)=

## Overriding helper classes

While 'view classes' are responsible for a lot of the work, there are also a number of other tasks that `modeladmin` must do regularly, that need to be handled in a consistent way, and in a number of different places. These tasks are designated to a set of simple classes (in `modeladmin`, these are termed 'helper' classes) and can be found in `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers`.

If you ever intend to write and use your own custom views with `modeladmin`, you should familiarise yourself with these helpers, as they are made available to views via the `modeladmin.views.WMABaseView` view.

There are three types of 'helper class':

-   **URL helpers** - That help with the consistent generation, naming and referencing of urls.
-   **Permission helpers** - That help with ensuring only users with sufficient permissions can perform certain actions, or see options to perform those actions.
-   **Button helpers** - That, with the help of the other two, helps with the generation of buttons for use in a number of places.

The `ModelAdmin` class allows you to define and use your own helper classes by setting values on the following attributes:

(modeladmin_url_helper_class)=

### `ModelAdmin.url_helper_class`

By default, the `modeladmin.helpers.url.PageAdminURLHelper` class is used when your model extends `wagtailcore.models.Page`, otherwise `modeladmin.helpers.url.AdminURLHelper` is used.

If you find that the above helper classes don't work for your needs, you can easily create your own helper class by sub-classing `AdminURLHelper` or `PageAdminURLHelper` (if your model extends Wagtail's `Page` model), and making any necessary additions/overrides.

Once your class is defined, set the `url_helper_class` attribute on your `ModelAdmin` class to use your custom URLHelper, like so:

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers import AdminURLHelper
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
from .models import MyModel


class MyURLHelper(AdminURLHelper):
    ...


class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    url_helper_class = MyURLHelper

modeladmin_register(MyModelAdmin)
```

Or, if you have a more complicated use case, where simply setting that attribute isn't possible (due to circular imports, for example) or doesn't meet your needs, you can override the `get_url_helper_class` method, like so:

```python
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel

    def get_url_helper_class(self):
        if self.some_attribute is True:
            return MyURLHelper
        return AdminURLHelper
```

(modeladmin_permission_helper_class)=

### `ModelAdmin.permission_helper_class`

By default, the `modeladmin.helpers.permission.PagePermissionHelper` class is used when your model extends `wagtailcore.models.Page`, otherwise `modeladmin.helpers.permission.PermissionHelper` is used.

If you find that the above helper classes don't work for your needs, you can easily create your own helper class, by sub-classing `PermissionHelper` (or `PagePermissionHelper` if your model extends Wagtail's `Page` model), and making any necessary additions/overrides. Once defined, you set the `permission_helper_class` attribute on your `ModelAdmin` class to use your custom class instead of the default, like so:

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers import PermissionHelper
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
from .models import MyModel


class MyPermissionHelper(PermissionHelper):
    ...


class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    permission_helper_class = MyPermissionHelper

modeladmin_register(MyModelAdmin)
```

Or, if you have a more complicated use case, where simply setting an attribute isn't possible or doesn't meet your needs, you can override the `get_permission_helper_class` method, like so:

```python
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel

    def get_permission_helper_class(self):
        if self.some_attribute is True:
            return MyPermissionHelper
        return PermissionHelper
```

(modeladmin_button_helper_class)=

### `ModelAdmin.button_helper_class`

By default, the `modeladmin.helpers.button.PageButtonHelper` class is used when your model extends `wagtailcore.models.Page`, otherwise `modeladmin.helpers.button.ButtonHelper` is used.

If you wish to add or change buttons for your model's IndexView, you'll need to create your own button helper class by sub-classing `ButtonHelper` or `PageButtonHelper` (if your model extend's Wagtail's `Page` model), and make any necessary additions/overrides. Once defined, you set the `button_helper_class` attribute on your `ModelAdmin` class to use your custom class instead of the default, like so:

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers import ButtonHelper
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
from .models import MyModel


class MyButtonHelper(ButtonHelper):
    def add_button(self, classnames_add=None, classnames_exclude=None):
        if classnames_add is None:
            classnames_add = []
        if classnames_exclude is None:
            classnames_exclude = []
        classnames = self.add_button_classnames + classnames_add
        cn = self.finalise_classname(classnames, classnames_exclude)
        return {
            'url': self.url_helper.create_url,
            'label': _('Add %s') % self.verbose_name,
            'classname': cn,
            'title': _('Add a new %s') % self.verbose_name,
        }

    def inspect_button(self, pk, classnames_add=None, classnames_exclude=None):
        ...

    def edit_button(self, pk, classnames_add=None, classnames_exclude=None):
        ...

    def delete_button(self, pk, classnames_add=None, classnames_exclude=None):
        ...


class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    button_helper_class = MyButtonHelper

modeladmin_register(MyModelAdmin)
```

To customise the buttons found in the ModelAdmin List View you can change the returned dictionary in the `add_button`, `delete_button`, `edit_button` or `inspect_button` methods. For example if you wanted to change the `Delete` button you could modify the `delete_button` method in your `ButtonHelper` like so:

```python
class MyButtonHelper(ButtonHelper):
    #...

    def delete_button(self, pk, classnames_add=None, classnames_exclude=None):
        #...
        return {
            'url': reverse("your_custom_url"),
            'label': _('Delete'),
            'classname': "custom-css-class",
            'title': _('Delete this item')
        }
```

Or, if you have a more complicated use case, where simply setting an attribute isn't possible or doesn't meet your needs, you can override the `get_button_helper_class` method, like so:

```python
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel

    def get_button_helper_class(self):
        if self.some_attribute is True:
            return MyButtonHelper
        return ButtonHelper
```

(modeladmin_helpers_in_custom_views)=

### Using helpers in your custom views

As long as you sub-class `modeladmin.views.WMABaseView` (or one of the more 'specific' view classes) to create your custom view, instances of each helper should be available on instances of your class as:

-   `self.url_helper`
-   `self.permission_helper`
-   `self.button_helper`

Unlike the other two, `self.button_helper` isn't populated right away when the view is instantiated. In order to show the right buttons for the right users, ButtonHelper instances need to be 'request aware', so `self.button_helper` is only set once the view's `dispatch()` method has run, which takes a `HttpRequest` object as an argument, from which the current user can be identified.
