What's new
==========

RoutablePage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``RoutablePage`` model has been added to allow embedding Django-style URL routing within a page.

:ref:`routable_page`


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core
----

 * Hooks can now be defined using decorator syntax:

  .. code-block:: python

    @hooks.register('construct_main_menu')
    def construct_main_menu(request, menu_items):
        menu_items.append(
            MenuItem('Kittens!', '/kittens/', classnames='icon icon-folder-inverse', order=1000)
        )

 * The lxml library (used for whitelisting and rewriting of rich text fields) has been replaced with the pure-python html5lib library, to simplify installation.


Admin
-----

 * Explorer nav now rendered separately and fetched with AJAX when needed.

   This improves the general performance of the admin interface for large sites.
