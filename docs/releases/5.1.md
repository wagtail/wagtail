## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Wagtail tutorial improvements

As part of Google Season of Docs 2023, we worked with technical writer Damilola Oladele to make improvements to Wagtail’s "Getting started" tutorial. Here are the specific changes made as part of this project:

 * Revamp the start of the getting started section, with separate quick install page
 * Move the tutorial’s snippets section to come before tags
 * Rewrite the getting started tutorial according to address identified friction points

Thank you to Damilola for his work, and to Google for sponsoring this project.

## Upgrade considerations

### `insert_editor_css` hook is deprecated

The `insert_editor_css` hook has been deprecated. The `insert_global_admin_css` hook has the same functionality, and all uses of `insert_editor_css` should be changed to `insert_global_admin_css`.

### `UserPagePermissionsProxy` is deprecated

The undocumented `wagtail.models.UserPagePermissionsProxy` class is deprecated.

If you use the `.for_page(page)` method of the class to get a `PagePermissionTester` instance, you can replace it with `page.permissions_for_user(user)`.

If you use the other methods, they can be replaced via the `wagtail.permission_policies.pages.PagePermissionPolicy` class. The following is a list of the `PagePermissionPolicy` equivalent of each method:

```python
from wagtail.models import UserPagePermissionsProxy
from wagtail.permission_policies.pages import PagePermissionPolicy

# proxy = UserPagePermissionsProxy(user)
permission_policy = PagePermissionPolicy()

# proxy.revisions_for_moderation()
permission_policy.revisions_for_moderation(user)

# proxy.explorable_pages()
permission_policy.explorable_instances(user)

# proxy.editable_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "change")

# proxy.can_edit_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "change").exists()

# proxy.publishable_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "publish")

# proxy.can_publish_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "publish").exists()

# proxy.can_remove_locks()
permission_policy.user_has_permission(user, "unlock")
```

The `UserPagePermissionsProxy` object that is available in page's `ActionMenuItem` context as `user_page_permissions` (which might be used as part of a `register_page_action_menu_item` hook) has been deprecated. In cases where the page object is available (e.g. the page edit view), the `PagePermissionTester` object stored as the `user_page_permissions_tester` context variable can still be used.

The `UserPagePermissionsProxy` object that is available in the template context as `user_page_permissions` as a side-effect of the `page_permissions` template tag has also been deprecated.

If you use the `user_page_permissions` context variable or use the `UserPagePermissionsProxy` class directly, make sure to replace it either with the `PagePermissionTester` or the `PagePermissionPolicy` equivalent.

### `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission`, `get_explorable_root_page`, and `users_with_page_permission` are deprecated

The undocumented `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission` and `get_explorable_root_page` functions in `wagtail.admin.navigation` are deprecated. They can be replaced with `PagePermissionPolicy().instances_with_direct_explore_permission(user)` and `PagePermissionPolicy().explorable_root_instance(user)`, respectively.

The undocumented `users_with_page_permission` function in `wagtail.admin.auth` is also deprecated. It can be replaced with `PagePermissionPolicy().users_with_permission_for_instance(action, page, include_superusers)`.

## `GroupPagePermission` now uses Django's `Permission` model

The `GroupPagePermission` model that is responsible for assigning page permissions to groups now uses Django's `Permission` model instead of a custom string. This means that the `permission_type` `CharField` has been deprecated and replaced with a `permission` `ForeignKey` to the `Permission` model.

In addition to this, "edit" permissions now use the term `change` within the code. As a result, `GroupPagePermission`s that were previously recorded with `permission_type="edit"` are now recorded with a `Permission` object that has the `codename="change_page"` and a `content_type` that points to the `Page` model. Any permission checks that are done using `PagePermissionPolicy` should also use `change` instead of `edit`.

If you have any fixtures for the `GroupPagePermission` model, you will need to update them to use the new `Permission` model. For example, if you have a fixture that looks like this:

```json
{
  "pk": 11,
  "model": "wagtailcore.grouppagepermission",
  "fields": {
    "group": ["Event moderators"],
    "page": 12,
    "permission_type": "edit"
  }
}
```

Update it to use a natural key for the `permission` field instead of the `permission_type` field:

```json
{
  "pk": 11,
  "model": "wagtailcore.grouppagepermission",
  "fields": {
    "group": ["Event moderators"],
    "page": 12,
    "permission": ["change_page", "wagtailcore", "page"]
  }
}
```

If you have any code that creates `GroupPagePermission` objects, you will need to update it to use the `Permission` model instead of the `permission_type` string. For example, if you have code that looks like this:

```python
from wagtail.core.models import GroupPagePermission

permission = GroupPagePermission(group=group, page=page, permission_type="edit")
permission.save()
```

Update it to use the `Permission` model instead:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from wagtail.core.models import GroupPagePermission

permission = GroupPagePermission(
    group=group,
    page=page,
    permission=Permission.objects.get(content_type__app_label="wagtailcore", codename="change_page"),
)
permission.save()
```

During the deprecation period, the `permission_type` field will still be available on the `GroupPagePermission` model and is used to automatically populate empty `permission` field as part of a system check. The `permission_type` field will be removed in Wagtail 6.0.


### The default ordering of Group Editing Permissions models has changed

The ordering for "Object permissions" and "Other permissions" now follows a predictable order equivalent do Django's default `Model` ordering.
This will be different to the previous ordering which never intentionally implemented.

This default ordering is now `["content_type__app_label", "content_type__model", "codename"]`, which can now be customised [](customising_group_views_permissions_order).

### Tag (Tagit) field usage now relies on data attributes

The `AdminTagWidget` widget has now been migrated to a Stimulus controller, if using this widget in Python, no changes are needed to adopt the new approach.

If the widget is being instantiated in JavaScript or HTML with the global util `window.initTagField`, this undocumented util should be replaced with the new `data-*` attributes approach. Additionally, any direct usage of the jQuery widget in JavaScript (e.g. `$('#my-element).tagit()`) should be removed.

The global util will be removed in a future release. It is recommended that the documented `AdminTagWidget` be used. However, if you need to use the JavaScript approach you can do this with the following example.

**Old syntax**

```html
<input id="id_tags" type="text" value="popular, technology" hidden />
<script>
    window.initTagField('id_tags', 'path/to/url', { autocompleteOnly: true });
</script>
```

**New syntax**

```html
<input
    id="id_tags"
    type="text"
    value="popular, technology"
    hidden
    data-controller="w-tag"
    data-w-tag-options-value='{"autocompleteOnly": true}'
    data-w-tag-url-value="/path/to/url"
/>
```

Note: The `data-w-tag-options-value` is a JSON object serialised into string. Django's HTML escaping will handle it automatically when you use the `AdminTagWidget`, but if you are manually writing the attributes, be sure to use quotation marks correctly.
