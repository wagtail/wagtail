## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` update

It's recommended that all projects set the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting to 10000 or higher.

This specifies the maximum number of fields allowed in a form submission, and it is recommended to increase this from Django's default of 1000, as particularly complex page models can exceed this limit within Wagtail's page editor:

```python
# settings.py
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 10_000
```

### Form builder - validation of fields with custom `related_name`

On previous releases, form page models (defined through `AbstractEmailForm`, `AbstractForm`, `FormMixin` or `EmailFormMixin`) did not validate form fields where the `related_name` was different to the default value of `form_fields`. As a result, it was possible to create forms with duplicate field names - in this case, only a single field is displayed and captured in the resulting form. As of Wagtail 6.4, validation is now applied on these fields. Existing forms will continue to behave as before and no data will be lost, but editing them will now raise a validation error.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Removal of unused Rangy JS library

The unused JavaScript include `wagtailadmin/js/vendor/rangy-core.js` has been removed from the editor interface, and functions such as `window.rangy.getSelection()` are no longer available. Any code relying on this should now either supply its own copy of the [Rangy library](https://github.com/timdown/rangy), or be migrated to the official [`Document.createRange()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) browser API.
