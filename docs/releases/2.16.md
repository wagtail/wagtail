## Upgrade considerations

### Removed support for Python 3.6

Python 3.6 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.7 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### StreamField ListBlock now returns `ListValue` rather than a list instance

The data type returned as the value of a ListBlock is now a custom class, `ListValue`, rather than a Python `list` object. This change allows it to provide a `bound_blocks` property that exposes the list items as [`BoundBlock` objects](../advanced_topics/boundblocks_and_values) rather than plain values. `ListValue` objects are mutable sequences that behave similarly to lists, and so all code that iterates over them, accesses individual elements, or manipulates them should continue to work. However, code that specifically expects a `list` object (e.g. using `isinstance` or testing for equality against a list) may need to be updated. For example, a unit test that tests the value of a `ListBlock` as follows:

```python
    self.assertEqual(page.body[0].value, ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```

should be rewritten as:

```python
    self.assertEqual(list(page.body[0].value), ['hello', 'goodbye'])
```
