## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Removal of `imghdr` and upgrade to `Willow`

[`imghdr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imghdr.html) is deprecated, and will be removed in Python 3.13.

Wagtail now uses the Willow feature of providing the image MIME type, which uses the [`filetype`](https://pypi.org/project/filetype/) package.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### Edit and delete URLs in `ModelViewSet` changed to allow non-integer primary keys

To accommodate models with non-integer primary keys, the URL patterns for the edit and delete views in {class}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet` have been changed.

Relative to the viewset's {attr}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_prefix`, the following changes have been made:
- The edit URL pattern has been changed from `<int:pk>/` to `edit/<str:pk>/`
- The delete URL pattern has been changed from `<int:pk>/delete/` to `delete/<str:pk>/`

If you use {func}`~django.urls.reverse` with {meth}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.get_url_name` to generate the URLs for these views, no changes are needed. However, if you have hard-coded these URLs in your code, you will need to update them to match the new patterns.

Redirects for the legacy URLs are in place for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in a future release.

The URLs for snippets underwent similar changes in Wagtail 2.14. The redirects for the legacy URLs in {class}`~wagtail.snippets.views.snippets.SnippetViewSet` have now been marked for removal in a future release.

### `ModelViewSet` automatically registers the model to the reference index

Models that are registered with a `ModelViewSet` now have reference index tracking enabled by default. This means that you no longer need to call `ReferenceIndex.register_model()` in your app's `ready()` method for such models. If this is undesired, you can disable it by setting {attr}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.add_to_reference_index` to `False` on the `ModelViewSet` subclass. For more details, see [](managing_the_reference_index).

### Groups `IndexView.results_template_name` renamed from `results.html` to `index_results.html`

The `IndexView`'s `results_template_name` attribute in the `GroupViewSet` has been renamed from `wagtailusers/groups/results.html` to `wagtailusers/groups/index_results.html` for consistency with the other viewsets. If you have customised or extended the template, e.g. for [](customising_group_views), you will need to rename it to match the new name.

### Breadcrumbs class name has changed

If using custom styling for the breadcrumbs, this class has changed from singular to plural for a more intuitive class.

| Old              | New               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `'w-breadcrumb'` | `'w-breadcrumbs'` |

### Breadcrumbs now use different data attributes and events

The undocumented JavaScript implementation for the header breadcrumbs component has been migrated to a Stimulus controller and now uses different data attributes.

This may impact custom header implementations that relied on the previous approach, custom breadcrumbs that did not use `breadcrumbs` and require the expand/collapse behaviour may be impacted.

#### Events

| Old                              | New                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `'wagtail:breadcrumbs-expand'`   | `'w-breadcrumbs:opened'` |
| `'wagtail:breadcrumbs-collapse'` | `'w-breadcrumbs:closed'` |

#### Data attributes

| Old                       | New                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `data-breadcrumb-next`    | `data-controller="w-breadcrumbs"`                                                                      |
| `data-toggle-breadcrumbs` | `data-w-breadcrumbs-target="toggle" data-action="w-breadcrumbs#toggle mouseenter->w-breadcrumbs#peek"` |
| `data-breadcrumb-item`    | `data-w-breadcrumbs-target="content"`                                                                  |

Note that the root DOM element also includes a set of additional data attributes to function as the breadcrumbs:

```
data-controller="w-breadcrumbs"
data-action="keyup.esc@document->w-breadcrumbs#close w-breadcrumbs:open@document->w-breadcrumbs#open w-breadcrumbs:close@document->w-breadcrumbs#close"
data-w-breadcrumbs-close-icon-class="icon-cross"
data-w-breadcrumbs-closed-value="true"
data-w-breadcrumbs-open-icon-class="icon-breadcrumb-expand"
data-w-breadcrumbs-opened-content-class="w-max-w-4xl"
data-w-breadcrumbs-peek-target-value="header"
```

### `window.updateFooterSaveWarning` global util removed

The undocumented global util `window.updateFooterSaveWarning` has been removed, this is part of the footer 'unsaved' messages toggling behaviour on page forms.
This behaviour has now moved to a Stimulus controller and leverages DOM events instead. Calling this function will do nothing and in a future release will throw an error.

You can implement roughly the equivalent functionality with this JavaScript function, however, this will not be guaranteed to work in future releases.

```js
window.updateFooterSaveWarning = (formDirty, commentsDirty) => {
  if (!formDirty && !commentsDirty) {
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('w-unsaved:clear'));
  } else {
    const [type] = [
      formDirty && commentsDirty && 'all',
      commentsDirty && 'comments',
      formDirty && 'edits',
    ].filter(Boolean);
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('w-unsaved:add', { detail: { type } }));
  }
};
```

### Snippets templates refactored to reuse the shared `slim_header.html` template

The templates for the snippets views have been refactored to reuse the shared `slim_header.html` template. If you have customised or extended the templates, e.g. for [](wagtailsnippets_custom_admin_views), you will need to update them to match the new structure. As a result, the following templates have been removed:

- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/_base_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/create_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/history_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/list_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/usage_header.html`

In most cases, the usage of those templates can be replaced with the `wagtailadmin/shared/headers/slim_header.html` template. Refer to the snippets views and templates code for more details.

### `dropdown` template tag argument `toggle_tippy_offset` renamed to `toggle_tooltip_offset`

The naming conventions for `tippy` related attributes have been updated to align with the generic `tooltip` naming.

If you are using the undocumented dropdown template tag with the offset arg, this will need to be updated.

| Old                                                                | New                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{% dropdown toggle_tippy_offset="[0, -2]" %}...{% enddropdown %}` | `{% dropdown toggle_tooltip_offset="[0, -2]" %}...{% enddropdown %}` |
