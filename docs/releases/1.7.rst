What's new
==========


Elasticsearch 2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now supports Elasticsearch 2. Note that you need to change backend in ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS``, if you wish to switch to Elasticsearch 2. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_elasticsearch`


AWS CloudFront support added to cache invalidation module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail's cache invalidation module can now invalidate pages cached in AWS CloudFront when they are updated or unpublished.
This feature was developed by Rob Moorman.

See: :ref:`frontendcache_aws_cloudfront`


Unpublishing subpages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpublishing a page now gives the option to unpublish its subpages at the same time. This feature was developed by Jordi Joan.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``wagtailforms`` module now provides a ``FormSubmissionPanel`` for displaying details of form submissions; see :ref:`wagtailforms_formsubmissionpanel` for documentation. (João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * The Wagtail version number can now be obtained as a tuple using ``from wagtail import VERSION`` (Tim Heap)
 * ``send_mail`` logic has been moved from ``AbstractEmailForm.process_form_submission`` into ``AbstractEmailForm.send_mail``. Now it's easier to override this logic (Tim Leguijt)
 * Added ``before_create_page``, ``before_edit_page``, ``before_delete_page`` hooks (Karl Hobley)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Migrations for wagtailcore and project template are now reversible (Benjamin Bach)
 * The default image format label text ('Full width', 'Left-aligned', 'Right-aligned') is now localised (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Text on the front-end 'password required' form is now marked for translation (Janneke Janssen)
 * Text on the page view restriction form is now marked for translation (Luiz Boaretto)
 * Fixed toggle behaviour of userbar on mobile (Robert Rollins)
 * Image rendition / document file deletion now happens on a post_delete signal, so that files are not lost if the deletion does not proceed (Janneke Janssen)
 * "Your recent edits" list on dashboard no longer leaves out pages that another user has subsequently edited (Michael Cordover, Kees Hink, João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * ``InlinePanel`` now accepts a ``classname`` parameter as per the documentation (emg36, Matt Westcott)
 * Disabled use of escape key to revert content of rich text fields, which could cause accidental data loss (Matt Westcott)


Upgrade considerations
======================

Project template's initial migration should not depend on ``wagtailcore.__latest__``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On projects created under previous releases of Wagtail, the ``home/migrations/0001_initial.py`` migration created by the ``wagtail start`` command contains the following dependency line:

.. code-block:: python

    dependencies = [
        ('wagtailcore', '__latest__'),
    ]

This may produce ``InconsistentMigrationHistory`` errors under Django 1.10 when upgrading Wagtail, since Django interprets this to mean that no new migrations can legally be added to wagtailcore after this migration is applied. This line should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    dependencies = [
        ('wagtailcore', '0029_unicode_slugfield_dj19'),
    ]
