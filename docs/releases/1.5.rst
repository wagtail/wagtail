Upgrade considerations
======================

The ``search_fields`` attribute on models should now be set to a list
=====================================================================

On searchable models (eg, ``Page`` or custom ``Image`` models) the ``search_fields`` attribute should now be a list instead of a tuple.

For example, the following ``Page`` model:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + (
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        )

Should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        ]

To ease the burden on third-party modules, adding tuples to ``Page.search_fields`` will still work. But this backwards-compatibility fix will be removed in Wagtail 1.7.

Elasticsearch backend now defaults to verifying SSL certs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, if you used the Elasticsearch backend, configured with the URLS property like:


.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch',
            'URLS': ['https://example.com/'],
        }
    }

Elasticsearch would not be configured to verify SSL certificates for HTTPS URLs. This has been changed so that SSL certificates are verified for HTTPS connections by default.

If you need the old behaviour back, where SSL certificates are not verified for your HTTPS connection, you can configure the Elasticsearch backend with the ``HOSTS`` option, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch',
            'HOSTS': [{
                'host': 'example.com'
                'use_ssl': True,
                'verify_certs': False,
            }],
        }
    }

See the `Elasticsearch-py documentation <http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/stable/#ssl-and-authentication>`_ for more configuration options.
