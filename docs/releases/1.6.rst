Upgrade considerations
======================

``TagSearchable`` needs removing from custom image / document model migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mixin class ``wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable``, used internally by image and document models, has been deprecated. If you are using custom image or document models in your project, the migration(s) which created them will contain frozen references to ``wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable``, which must now be removed. The line:

.. code-block:: python

    import wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable

should be replaced by:

.. code-block:: python

    import wagtail.wagtailsearch.index

and the line:

.. code-block:: python

    bases=(models.Model, wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable),

should be updated to:

.. code-block:: python

    bases=(models.Model, wagtail.wagtailsearch.index.Indexed),
