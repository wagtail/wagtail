/* =============================================================================
/*  Wagtail CMS sidebar stylesheet entrypoint
/* =============================================================================

The sidebar is implemented in its own stylesheet so that it can be used
by different frontend frameworks.

This stylesheet follows the same conventions as the rest of Wagtail,
see core.scss for details.
