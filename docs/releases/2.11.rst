Upgrade considerations
======================

SiteMiddleware moved to ``wagtail.contrib.legacy``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SiteMiddleware class (which provides the ``request.site`` property, and has been deprecated since Wagtail 2.9) has been moved to the ``wagtail.contrib.legacy`` namespace. On projects where this is still in use, the ``'wagtail.core.middleware.SiteMiddleware'`` entry in ``MIDDLEWARES`` should be changed to ``'wagtail.contrib.legacy.sitemiddleware.SiteMiddleware'``.
