Wagtail 6.3 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).

## What's new

### Python 3.13 support

This release adds formal support for Python 3.13.

### Django 5.1 support

This release adds formal support for Django 5.1.

### `ImageBlock` with alt text support

This release introduces a new block type [`ImageBlock`](streamfield_imageblock), which improves upon `ImageChooserBlock` by allowing editors to specify alt text tailored to the context in which the image is used. This can be used as a direct replacement for `ImageChooserBlock`, and is the new recommended block type for all images that are not purely decorative. This feature was developed by Chiemezuo Akujobi as part of the Google Summer of Code program with mentoring support from Storm Heg, Saptak Sengupta, Thibaud Colas and Matt Westcott.

### Incremental dashboard enhancements

The Wagtail dashboard design evolves towards providing more information and navigation features. Mobile support is much improved. Upgrade banners are now dismissible.

This feature was developed by Albina Starykova and Sage Abdullah, based on designs by Ben Enright.

### Enhanced contrast admin theme

CMS users can now control the level of contrast of UI elements in the admin interface.
This new customization is designed for partially sighted users, complementing existing support for a dark theme and Windows Contrast Themes.
The new "More contrast" theming can be enabled in account preferences, or will otherwise be derived from operating system preferences.

This feature was designed thanks to feedback from our blind and partially sighted users, and was developed by Albina Starykova based on design input from Victoria Ottah.

### Universal design

This release follows through with "universal listings" user experience and design consistency improvements earlier in 2024, with the following features.

 * All create/edit admin forms now use a sticky submit button, for consistency and to speed up edits
 * Secondary form actions such as "Delete" are now in the header actions menu, for consistency and to make the actions more easily reachable for keyboard users
 * Documents and Images views now use universal listings styles
 * Page type usage, workflow usage, and workflow history views views also use universal listings styles
 * The forms pages listing now supports search and filtering

These features were developed by Sage Abdullah.

### HEIC / HEIF image upload support

The `WAGTAILIMAGES_EXTENSIONS` setting now accepts the `heic` extension, which allows users to upload and use HEIC / HEIF images in Wagtail. These images are automatically converted to JPEG format when rendered. For more details, see [](heic_heif_images).

This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

### Custom preview sizes support

You can now customize the preview device sizes available in the live preview panel by overriding {attr}`~wagtail.models.PreviewableMixin.preview_sizes`. The default size can also be set by overriding {attr}`~wagtail.models.PreviewableMixin.default_preview_size`.

This feature was developed by Bart Cieliński, alexkiro, and Sage Abdullah.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### Removed support for Python 3.8

Python 3.8 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.9 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### Deprecation of the `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW` setting

The [`WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW`](wagtail_auto_update_preview) setting has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

To disable the automatic preview update feature, set [`WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL = 0`](wagtail_auto_update_preview_interval) in your Django settings instead.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Deprecation of `window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE`

As part of migrating away from inline scripts, the undocumented use of `window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE` as a global has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

**Old**

```html+django
{% block extra_js %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <script>
        window.wagtailConfig.BULK_ACTION_ITEM_TYPE = 'SOME_ITEM';
    </script>
{% endblock %}
```

**New**

Update usage of the `wagtailadmin/bulk_actions/footer.html` template include to declare the `item_type`.

```html+django
{% block bulk_actions %}
    {% include 'wagtailadmin/bulk_actions/footer.html' ... item_type="SOME_ITEM" %}
{% endblock %}
```

```{note}
Custom item types for bulk actions are not officially supported yet and this approach is likely to get further changes in the future.
```

### Deprecation of the `{% locales %}` template tag

The undocumented `locales` template tag will be removed in a future release.

If access to JSON locales within JavaScript is needed, use `window.wagtailConfig.LOCALES` instead.

### Deprecation of the `{% js_translation_strings %}` template tag

The undocumented `js_translation_strings` template tag will be removed in a future release.

If access to JSON translation strings within JavaScript is needed, use `window.wagtailConfig.STRINGS` instead.

### `UpgradeNotificationPanel` is no longer removable with `construct_homepage_panels` hook

The upgrade notification panel can still be removed with the [`WAGTAIL_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK = False`](update_notifications) setting.

### `SiteSummaryPanel` is no longer removable with `construct_homepage_panels`hook

The summary items can still be removed with the [`construct_homepage_summary_items`](construct_homepage_summary_items) hook.

### Deprecation of `DeleteMenuItem`

The undocumented `DeleteMenuItem` API will be removed in a future release.

The delete option is now provided via `EditView.get_header_more_buttons()`, though this is still an internal-only API.
