## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Wagtail tutorial improvements

As part of Google Season of Docs 2023, we worked with technical writer Damilola Oladele to make improvements to Wagtail’s "Getting started" tutorial. Here are the specific changes made as part of this project:

 * Revamp the start of the getting started section, with separate quick install page
 * Move the tutorial’s snippets section to come before tags
 * Rewrite the getting started tutorial to address identified friction points
 * Switch the Getting started tutorial’s snippets example to be more understandable

Thank you to Damilola for his work, and to Google for sponsoring this project.

### Custom template support for `wagtail start`

The `wagtail start` command now supports an optional `--template` argument that allows you to specify a custom project template to use. This is useful if you want to use a custom template that includes additional features or customisations. For more details, see [the project template reference](/reference/project_template). This feature was developed by Thibaud Colas.

### Search query boosting on Elasticsearch 6 and above

The `boost` option on `SearchField`, to increase the ranking of search results that match on the specified field, is now respected by Elasticsearch 6 and above. This was previously only supported up to Elasticsearch 5, due to a change in Elasticsearch's API. This feature was developed by Shohan Dutta Roy.

### Elasticsearch 8 support

This release adds support for Elasticsearch 8. This can be set up by installing a version 8.x release of the `elasticsearch` Python package, and setting `wagtail.search.backends.elasticsearch8` as the search backend. Compatibility updates were contributed by Matt Westcott and Wesley van Lee.

### Extend Stimulus adoption

As part of tackling Wagtail’s technical debt and improving [CSP compatibility](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/1288), we have continued extending our usage of Stimulus, based on the plans laid out in [RFC 78: Adopt Stimulus](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/78).

* Add support for `attrs` on `FieldPanel` and other panels to aid in custom Stimulus usage (Aman Pandey, Antoni Martyniuk, LB (Ben) Johnston)
* Migrate Tagit initialisation to a Stimulus Controller (LB (Ben) Johnston)
* Migrate legacy dropdown implementation to a Stimulus controller (Thibaud Colas)
* Migrate async header search and search with the Task chooser modal to `w-swap`, a Stimulus controller (LB (Ben) Johnston)
* Replace Bootstrap tooltips with a new `w-tooltip` Stimulus controller (LB (Ben) Johnston)
* Migrate dialog instantiation to a new `w-dialog` Stimulus controller (Loveth Omokaro, LB (Ben) Johnston)
* Support dialog template cloning using a new `w-teleport` Stimulus controller (Loveth Omokaro, LB (Ben) Johnston)

### AVIF image support

Wagtail now supports [AVIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF), a modern image format. We encourage all site implementers to consider using it to improve the performance of the sites and reduce their carbon footprint. For further details, see [image file format](image_file_formats), [output image format](output_image_format) and [image quality](image_quality).

This feature was developed by Aman Pandey as part of the Google Summer of Code program and a [partnership with the Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/working-with-the-wagtail-community-on-the-summer-of-code/) and Green Coding Berlin, with support from Dan Braghis, Thibaud Colas, Sage Abdullah, Arne Tarara (Green Coding Berlin), and Chris Adams (Green Web Foundation).

## Upgrade considerations

### Removed support for Python 3.7

Python 3.7 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.8 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

### Pillow dependency update

Wagtail no longer supports Pillow versions below `9.1.0`.

### `insert_editor_css` hook is deprecated

The `insert_editor_css` hook has been deprecated. The `insert_global_admin_css` hook has the same functionality, and all uses of `insert_editor_css` should be changed to `insert_global_admin_css`.

### `UserPagePermissionsProxy` is deprecated

The undocumented `wagtail.models.UserPagePermissionsProxy` class is deprecated.

If you use the `.for_page(page)` method of the class to get a `PagePermissionTester` instance, you can replace it with `page.permissions_for_user(user)`.

If you use the other methods, they can be replaced via the `wagtail.permission_policies.pages.PagePermissionPolicy` class. The following is a list of the `PagePermissionPolicy` equivalent of each method:

```python
from wagtail.models import UserPagePermissionsProxy
from wagtail.permission_policies.pages import PagePermissionPolicy

# proxy = UserPagePermissionsProxy(user)
permission_policy = PagePermissionPolicy()

# proxy.revisions_for_moderation()
permission_policy.revisions_for_moderation(user)

# proxy.explorable_pages()
permission_policy.explorable_instances(user)

# proxy.editable_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "change")

# proxy.can_edit_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "change").exists()

# proxy.publishable_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "publish")

# proxy.can_publish_pages()
permission_policy.instances_user_has_permission_for(user, "publish").exists()

# proxy.can_remove_locks()
permission_policy.user_has_permission(user, "unlock")
```

The `UserPagePermissionsProxy` object that is available in page's `ActionMenuItem` context as `user_page_permissions` (which might be used as part of a `register_page_action_menu_item` hook) has been deprecated. In cases where the page object is available (e.g. the page edit view), the `PagePermissionTester` object stored as the `user_page_permissions_tester` context variable can still be used.

The `UserPagePermissionsProxy` object that is available in the template context as `user_page_permissions` as a side-effect of the `page_permissions` template tag has also been deprecated.

If you use the `user_page_permissions` context variable or use the `UserPagePermissionsProxy` class directly, make sure to replace it either with the `PagePermissionTester` or the `PagePermissionPolicy` equivalent.

### `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission`, `get_explorable_root_page`, and `users_with_page_permission` are deprecated

The undocumented `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission` and `get_explorable_root_page` functions in `wagtail.admin.navigation` are deprecated. They can be replaced with `PagePermissionPolicy().instances_with_direct_explore_permission(user)` and `PagePermissionPolicy().explorable_root_instance(user)`, respectively.

The undocumented `users_with_page_permission` function in `wagtail.admin.auth` is also deprecated. It can be replaced with `PagePermissionPolicy().users_with_permission_for_instance(action, page, include_superusers)`.

### `GroupPagePermission` now uses Django's `Permission` model

The `GroupPagePermission` model that is responsible for assigning page permissions to groups now uses Django's `Permission` model instead of a custom string. This means that the `permission_type` `CharField` has been deprecated and replaced with a `permission` `ForeignKey` to the `Permission` model.

In addition to this, "edit" permissions now use the term `change` within the code. As a result, `GroupPagePermission`s that were previously recorded with `permission_type="edit"` are now recorded with a `Permission` object that has the `codename="change_page"` and a `content_type` that points to the `Page` model. Any permission checks that are done using `PagePermissionPolicy` should also use `change` instead of `edit`.

If you have any fixtures for the `GroupPagePermission` model, you will need to update them to use the new `Permission` model. For example, if you have a fixture that looks like this:

```json
{
  "pk": 11,
  "model": "wagtailcore.grouppagepermission",
  "fields": {
    "group": ["Event moderators"],
    "page": 12,
    "permission_type": "edit"
  }
}
```

Update it to use a natural key for the `permission` field instead of the `permission_type` field:

```json
{
  "pk": 11,
  "model": "wagtailcore.grouppagepermission",
  "fields": {
    "group": ["Event moderators"],
    "page": 12,
    "permission": ["change_page", "wagtailcore", "page"]
  }
}
```

If you have any code that creates `GroupPagePermission` objects, you will need to update it to use the `Permission` model instead of the `permission_type` string. For example, if you have code that looks like this:

```python
from wagtail.core.models import GroupPagePermission

permission = GroupPagePermission(group=group, page=page, permission_type="edit")
permission.save()
```

Update it to use the `Permission` model instead:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from wagtail.core.models import GroupPagePermission

permission = GroupPagePermission(
    group=group,
    page=page,
    permission=Permission.objects.get(content_type__app_label="wagtailcore", codename="change_page"),
)
permission.save()
```

During the deprecation period, the `permission_type` field will still be available on the `GroupPagePermission` model and is used to automatically populate empty `permission` field as part of a system check. The `permission_type` field will be removed in Wagtail 6.0.

### The default ordering of Group Editing Permissions models has changed

The ordering for "Object permissions" and "Other permissions" now follows a predictable order equivalent to Django's default `Model` ordering.
This will be different to the previous ordering which never intentionally implemented.

The default ordering is now `["content_type__app_label", "content_type__model"]`, which can now be customised [](customising_group_views_permissions_order).

### Shared include `wagtailadmin/shared/last_updated.html` is no longer available

The undocumented shared include `wagtailadmin/shared/last_updated.html` is no longer available as it used the legacy Bootstrap tooltips and was not accessible. If you need to achieve a similar output, an element that shows a simple date with a tooltip for the full date, use the `human_readable_date` template tag instead.

#### Before

```html+django
{% include "wagtailadmin/shared/last_updated.html" with last_updated=my_model.timestamp %}
```

#### After

```html+django
{% load wagtailadmin_tags %}

<!-- ... -->
{% human_readable_date my_model.timestamp %}
```

### Shared include `field_as_li.html` is no longer available

The documented include `"wagtailadmin/shared/field_as_li.html"` has been removed, if being used it will need to be replaced with `"wagtailadmin/shared/field.html"` wrapped within `li` tags.

#### Before

```html+django
{% include "wagtailadmin/shared/field_as_li.html" %}
```

#### After

```html+django
<li>
    {% include "wagtailadmin/shared/field.html" %}
</li>
```

### Tag (Tagit) field usage now relies on data attributes

The `AdminTagWidget` widget has now been migrated to a Stimulus controller, if using this widget in Python, no changes are needed to adopt the new approach.

If the widget is being instantiated in JavaScript or HTML with the global util `window.initTagField`, this undocumented util should be replaced with the new `data-*` attributes approach. Additionally, any direct usage of the jQuery widget in JavaScript (e.g. `$('#my-element).tagit()`) should be removed.

The global util will be removed in a future release. It is recommended that the documented `AdminTagWidget` be used. However, if you need to use the JavaScript approach you can do this with the following example.

#### Old syntax

```html
<input id="id_tags" type="text" value="popular, technology" hidden />
<script>
    window.initTagField('id_tags', 'path/to/url', { autocompleteOnly: true });
</script>
```

#### New syntax

```html
<input
    id="id_tags"
    type="text"
    value="popular, technology"
    hidden
    data-controller="w-tag"
    data-w-tag-options-value='{"autocompleteOnly": true}'
    data-w-tag-url-value="/path/to/url"
/>
```

Note: The `data-w-tag-options-value` is a JSON object serialised into string. Django's HTML escaping will handle it automatically when you use the `AdminTagWidget`, but if you are manually writing the attributes, be sure to use quotation marks correctly.

### Image Renditions are now cached by default

Wagtail will try to use the cache called "renditions". If no such cache exists, it will fall back to using the default cache.
You can [configure the "renditions" cache](custom_image_renditions_cache) to use a different cache backend or to provide
additional configuration parameters.

### Tooltips now rely on new data attributes

The undocumented Bootstrap jQuery tooltip widget is no longer in use, you will need to update any HTML that is using these attributes to the new syntax.

```html
<!-- Old attributes: -->
<span data-wagtail-tooltip="Tooltip content here">Label</span>
<!-- New attributes: -->
<span data-controller="w-tooltip" data-w-tooltip-content-value="Tooltip content here">Label</span>
```

### Dialog hide/show custom events name change

The undocumented client-side Custom Event handling for dialog showing & hiding will change in a future release.

| Action | Old event      | New event       |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Show   | `wagtail:show` | `w-dialog:show` |
| Hide   | `wagtail:hide` | `w-dialog:hide` |

Additionally, two new events will be dispatched when the dialog visibility changes.

| Action | Event name        |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| Show   | `w-dialog:shown`  |
| Hide   | `w-dialog:hidden` |

### JSON-timestamps stored in `ModelLogEntry` and `PageLogEntry` are now ISO-formatted and UTC

Previously, timestamps stored in the "data"-`JSONField` of `ModelLogEntry` and `PageLogEntry` have used the custom python format `%d %b %Y %H:%M`. Additionally, the `"go_live_at"` timestamp had been stored with the configured local timezone, instead of UTC.

This has now been fixed, all timestamps are now stored as UTC, and because the "data"-`JSONField` now uses Django's `DjangoJSONEncoder`, those `datetime` objects are now automatically converted to the ISO format. This release contains a new migration `0088_fix_log_entry_json_timestamps` which converts all existing timestamps used by Wagtail to the new format.

If you've developed your own subclasses of `ModelLogEntry`, `PageLogEntry` or `BaseLogEntry`, or used those existing models to create custom log entries, and you've stored timestamps similarly to Wagtail's old implementation (using `strftime("%d %b %Y %H:%M")`). You may want to adapt the storage of those timestamps to a consistent format too.

There are probably three places in your code, which have to be changed:

1. Creation: Instead of using `strftime("%d %b %Y %H:%M")`, you can now store the datetime directly in the "data" field. We've implemented a new helper `wagtail.utils.timestamps.ensure_utc()`, which ensures the correct timezone (UTC).
2. Display: To display the timestamp in the user's timezone and format with a `LogFormatter`, we've created utils to parse (`wagtail.utils.timestamps.parse_datetime_localized()`) and render (`wagtail.utils.timestamps.render_timestamp()`) those timestamps. Look at the existing formatters [here](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/main/wagtail/wagtail_hooks.py).
3. Migration: You can use the code of the above migration ([source](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/main/wagtail/migrations/0088_fix_log_entry_json_timestamps.py)) as a guideline to migrate your existing timestamps in the database.
