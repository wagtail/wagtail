Search

Wagtail provides a comprehensive and extensible search interface. In addition, it provides ways to promote search results through "Editor's Picks". Wagtail also collects simple statistics on queries made through the search interface.

Indexing
========

To make objects searchable, they firstly need to be added to the search index. This involves configuring the models/fields that you would like to index (this is done for you for Pages, Images and Documents) and then actually inserting them into the index.

See :ref:`wagtailsearch_indexing_update` for information on how to keep the objects in your search index in sync with the objects in your database.

If you have created some extra fields in a subclass of ``Page`` or ``Image``, you may want to add these new fields to the search index too so a users search query will match on their content. See :ref:`wagtailsearch_indexing_fields`.

If you have a custom model which doesn't derive from ``Page`` or ``Image`` that you would like to make searchable, see :ref:`wagtailsearch_indexing_models`.


Searching
=========

Wagtail provides an API for performing search queries on your models. You can also perform search queries on Django QuerySets.

See :ref:`wagtailsearch_searching`.


Backends
========

Wagtail provides two backends for storing the search index and performing search queries: Elasticsearch and the database. It's also possible to roll your own search backend.

See :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends`
