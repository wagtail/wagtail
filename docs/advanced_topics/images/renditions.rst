.. _image_renditions:

Generating renditions in Python
=====================================

Rendered versions of original images generated by the Wagtail ``{% image %}`` template tag are called "renditions,"
and are stored as new image files in the site's ``[media]/images`` directory on the first invocation.

Image renditions can also be generated dynamically from Python via the native ``get_rendition()`` method, e.g.:

 .. code-block:: python

    newimage = myimage.get_rendition('fill-300x150|jpegquality-60')

Argument options are identical to arguments accepted by the ``{% image %}`` template tag, and should be separated
with ``|``.

The ``newimage`` object will have all of the usual properties of a Wagtail image (such as URL), so something like
this could be used in an API generator, for example:

 .. code-block:: python

    url = myimage.get_rendition('fill-300x186|jpegquality-60').url

If ``myimage`` had a filename of ``foo.jpg``, a new file called ``foo.fill-300x150.jpegquality-60.jpg`` would be
generated and saved into the site's ``[media]/images`` directory.
