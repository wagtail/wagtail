What's new
==========

Facebook and Instagram embed finders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two new embed finders have been added for Facebook and Instagram, to replace the previous configuration
using Facebook's public oEmbed endpoint which was retired in October 2020. These require a Facebook
developer API key - for details of configuring this, see :ref:`facebook_and_instagram_embeds`.
This feature was developed by Cynthia Kiser and Luis Nell.
