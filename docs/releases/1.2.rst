What's new
==========

 * WagtailRedirectMiddleware can now ignore the query string if there is no redirect that exactly matches it
 * Order of URL parameters now ignored by redirect middleware
 * Added SQL Server compatibility to image migration
 * Added classnames to Wagtail rich text editor buttons to aid custom styling
 * Simplified body_class in default homepage template
 * page_published signal now called with the revision object that was published
 * Added a favicon to the admin interface, customisable by overriding the ``branding_favicon`` block (see :ref:`custom_branding`).

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Deleting a page permission from the groups admin UI does not immediately submit the form
 * Wagtail userbar is shown on pages that do not pass a ``page`` variable to the template (e.g. because they override the ``serve`` method)
