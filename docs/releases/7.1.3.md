### CVE-2026-25517: Improper permission handling on admin preview endpoints

This release addresses a permission vulnerability in the Wagtail admin interface. Due to a missing permission check on the preview endpoints, a user with access to the Wagtail admin and knowledge of a model's fields can craft a form submission to obtain a preview rendering of any page, snippet or site setting object for which previews are enabled, consisting of any data of the user's choosing. The existing data of the object itself is not exposed, but depending on the nature of the template being rendered, this may expose other database contents that would otherwise only be accessible to users with edit access over the model. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

### Bug fixes

 * Allow userbar in page previews to render without needing to configure site record (Sage Abdullah)
 * Disable usage count ordering when searching on documents and images listing views, to prevent unsupported search query (Sage Abdullah)
 * Prevent conflicting IDs in nested `StructBlock`s with blocks named `content` (Sage Abdullah, Serkan Korkusuz)
