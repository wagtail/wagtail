Demo site
=========


To create a new site on Wagtail we recommend the ``wagtail start`` command in :doc:`index`; however, a demo site, The Wagtail Bakery, exists containing example page types and models. We also recommend you use the demo site for testing during development of Wagtail itself.

The repo and installation instructions can be found here: `https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo <https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo>`_
