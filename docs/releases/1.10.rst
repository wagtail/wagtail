Upgrade considerations
======================

Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 support dropped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 has been dropped in this release; please upgrade from these before upgrading Wagtail. Note that the Django 1.8 release series is still supported, as a Long Term Support release.


Dropped support for generating static sites using ``django-medusa``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django-medusa is no longer maintained, and is incompatible with Django 1.8 and above. An alternative module based on the `django-bakery`_ package is available as a third-party contribution: https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-bakery.


Signals on custom ``Image`` and ``Rendition`` models connected automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects using :ref:`custom image models <custom_image_model>` no longer need to set up signal receivers to handle deletion of image files and image feature detection, as these are now handled automatically by Wagtail. The following lines of code should be removed:

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete the source image file when an image is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Delete the rendition image file when a rendition is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomRendition)
    def rendition_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Perform image feature detection (if enabled)
    @receiver(pre_save, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_feature_detection(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        if not instance.has_focal_point():
            instance.set_focal_point(instance.get_suggested_focal_point())


Adding / editing users through Wagtail admin no longer sets ``is_staff`` flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the ``is_staff`` flag (which grants access to the Django admin interface) was automatically set for superusers, and reset for other users, when creating and updating users through the Wagtail admin. This behaviour has now been removed, since Wagtail is designed to work independently of the Django admin. If you need to reinstate the old behaviour, you can set up a `pre_save signal handler <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/signals/#django.db.models.signals.pre_save>`_ on the User model to set the flag appropriately.
