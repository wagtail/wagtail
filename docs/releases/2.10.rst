What's new
==========

Search query expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search queries can now be constructed as structured expressions in the manner of the Django ORM's ``Q()`` values, allowing for complex queries that combine individual terms, phrases and boosting. A helper function ``parse_query_string`` is provided to convert "natural" queries containing quoted phrases into these expressions. For complete documentation, see :ref:`wagtailsearch_complex_queries`. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley and sponsored by `The Motley Fool <https://www.fool.com/>`_.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Removed support for Python 3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.5 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.6 or above before upgrading Wagtail.



Move to new configurable moderation system (workflow)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new workflow system has been introduced for moderation. Task types are defined as models in code, and instances - tasks - are created in the Wagtail Admin,
then chained together to form workflows: sequences of moderation stages through which a page must pass prior to publication.

Key points:

* Prior to 2.9, moderation in Wagtail was performed on a per-revision basis: once submitted, the moderator would approve or reject
  the submitted revision only, which would not include subsequent changes. Moderation is now performed per page, with moderators
  always seeing the latest revision.
* ``PageRevision.submitted_for_moderation`` will return ``True`` for revisions passing through the old moderation system, but not for the new system
* Pages undergoing moderation in the old system will not have their moderation halted, and can still be approved/rejected. As a result, you may see
  two sets of moderation dashboard panels until there are no longer any pages in moderation in the old system
* No pages can be submitted for moderation in the old system: "Submit for moderation" now submits to the new Workflow system
* You no longer need the publish permission to perform moderation actions on a page - actions available to each user are now configured per task.
  With the built in ``GroupApprovalTask``, anybody in a specific set of groups can approve or reject the task.
* A data migration is provided to recreate your existing publish-permission based moderation workflow in the new system. If you have made no permissions changes,
  this should simply create a task approvable by anybody in the `Moderators` group, and assign a workflow with this task to the root page, creating a standard workflow
  for the entire page tree. However, if you have a complex nested set of publish page permissions, the created set of workflows will be more complex as well - you may wish to
  inspect the created workflows and tasks in the new ``Settings/Workflows`` admin area and potentially simplify them.
  See :ref:`managing_workflows` for the administrator guide.

``<div class="rich-text">`` wrappers removed from rich text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous releases, rich text values were enclosed in a ``<div class="rich-text">`` element when rendered; this element has now been removed.
To restore the old behaviour, see :ref:`legacy_richtext`.
