==============================
Configuring Django for Wagtail
==============================

To install Wagtail completely from scratch, create a new Django project and an app within that project. For instructions on these tasks, see `Writing your first Django app <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_. Your project directory will look like the following::

  myproject/
      myproject/
          __init__.py
          settings.py
          urls.py
          wsgi.py
      myapp/
          __init__.py
          models.py
          tests.py
          admin.py
          views.py
      manage.py

From your app directory, you can safely remove ``admin.py`` and ``views.py``, since Wagtail will provide this functionality for your models. Configuring Django to load Wagtail involves adding modules and variables to ``settings.py`` and URL configuration to ``urls.py``. For a more complete view of what's defined in these files, see `Django Settings <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/>`__ and `Django URL Dispatcher <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/>`_.

What follows is a settings reference which skips many boilerplate Django settings. If you just want to get your Wagtail install up quickly without fussing with settings at the moment, see :ref:`complete_example_config`.


Middleware (``settings.py``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',

    'wagtail.wagtailcore.middleware.SiteMiddleware',

    'wagtail.wagtailredirects.middleware.RedirectMiddleware',
  )

Wagtail requires several common Django middleware modules to work and cover basic security. Wagtail provides its own middleware to cover these tasks:

``SiteMiddleware``
  Wagtail routes pre-defined hosts to pages within the Wagtail tree using this middleware.

``RedirectMiddleware``
  Wagtail provides a simple interface for adding arbitrary redirects to your site and this module makes it happen.


Apps (``settings.py``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    'compressor',
    'taggit',
    'modelcluster',

    'wagtail.wagtailcore',
    'wagtail.wagtailadmin',
    'wagtail.wagtaildocs',
    'wagtail.wagtailsnippets',
    'wagtail.wagtailusers',
    'wagtail.wagtailimages',
    'wagtail.wagtailembeds',
    'wagtail.wagtailsearch',
    'wagtail.wagtailsites',
    'wagtail.wagtailredirects',
    'wagtail.wagtailforms',

    'myapp',  # your own app
  )

Wagtail requires several Django app modules, third-party apps, and defines several apps of its own. Wagtail was built to be modular, so many Wagtail apps can be omitted to suit your needs. Your own app (here ``myapp``) is where you define your models, templates, static assets, template tags, and other custom functionality for your site.


Third-Party Apps
----------------

``compressor``
  Static asset combiner and minifier for Django. Compressor also enables for the use of preprocessors. See `Compressor Documentation`_.

.. _Compressor Documentation: http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

``taggit``
  Tagging framework for Django. This is used internally within Wagtail for image and document tagging and is available for your own models as well. See :ref:`tagging` for a Wagtail model recipe or the `Taggit Documentation`_.

.. _Taggit Documentation: http://django-taggit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

``modelcluster``
  Extension of Django ForeignKey relation functionality, which is used in Wagtail pages for on-the-fly related object creation. For more information, see :ref:`inline_panels` or `the django-modelcluster github project page`_.

.. _the django-modelcluster github project page: https://github.com/torchbox/django-modelcluster


Wagtail Apps
------------

``wagtailcore``
  The core functionality of Wagtail, such as the ``Page`` class, the Wagtail tree, and model fields.

``wagtailadmin``
  The administration interface for Wagtail, including page edit handlers.

``wagtaildocs``
  The Wagtail document content type.

``wagtailsnippets``
  Editing interface for non-Page models and objects. See :ref:`Snippets`.

``wagtailusers``
  User editing interface.

``wagtailimages``
  The Wagtail image content type.

``wagtailembeds``
  Module governing oEmbed and Embedly content in Wagtail rich text fields. See :ref:`inserting_videos`.

``wagtailsearch``
  Search framework for Page content. See :ref:`search`.

``wagtailredirects``
  Admin interface for creating arbitrary redirects on your site.

``wagtailforms``
  Models for creating forms on your pages and viewing submissions. See :ref:`form_builder`.


Settings Variables (``settings.py``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Site Name
---------

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME = 'Stark Industries Skunkworks'

This is the human-readable name of your Wagtail install which welcomes users upon login to the Wagtail admin.


Search
------

.. code-block:: python

  # Override the search results template for wagtailsearch
  WAGTAILSEARCH_RESULTS_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/search_results.html'
  WAGTAILSEARCH_RESULTS_TEMPLATE_AJAX = 'myapp/includes/search_listing.html'

  # Replace the search backend
  WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
    'default': {
      'BACKEND': 'wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch',
      'INDEX': 'myapp'
    }
  }

The search settings customise the search results templates as well as choosing a custom backend for search. For a full explanation, see :ref:`search`.


Embeds
------

Wagtail uses the oEmbed standard with a large but not comprehensive number of "providers" (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.). You can also use a different embed backend by providing an Embedly key or replacing the embed backend by writing your own embed finder function.

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBED_FINDER = 'myapp.embeds.my_embed_finder_function'

Use a custom embed finder function, which takes a URL and returns a dict with metadata and embeddable HTML. Refer to the ``wagtail.wagtailemebds.embeds`` module source for more information and examples.

.. code-block:: python

  # not a working key, get your own!
  WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBEDLY_KEY = '253e433d59dc4d2xa266e9e0de0cb830'

Providing an API key for the Embedly service will use that as a embed backend, with a more extensive list of providers, as well as analytics and other features. For more information, see `Embedly`_.

.. _Embedly: http://embed.ly/

To use Embedly, you must also install their Python module:

.. code-block:: sh

  pip install embedly


Images
------

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL = 'myapp.MyImage'

This setting lets you provide your own image model for use in Wagtail, which might extend the built-in ``AbstractImage`` class or replace it entirely.



Password Management
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED = True

This allows users to change their passwords.

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED = True

This allows users to reset their passwords.



Email Notifications
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL = 'wagtail@myhost.io'

Wagtail sends email notifications when content is submitted for moderation, and when the content is accepted or rejected. This setting lets you pick which email address these automatic notifications will come from. If omitted, Django will fall back to using the ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` variable if set, and ``webmaster@localhost`` if not.


.. _update_notifications:

Wagtail update notifications
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  WAGTAIL_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK = True

For admins only, Wagtail performs a check on the dashboard to see if newer releases are available. This also provides the Wagtail team with the hostname of your Wagtail site. If you'd rather not receive update notifications, or if you'd like your site to remain unknown, you can disable it with this setting.


Private Pages
-------------

.. code-block:: python

  PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/password_required.html'

This is the path to the Django template which will be used to display the "password required" form when a user accesses a private page. For more details, see the :ref:`private_pages` documentation.


Other Django Settings Used by Wagtail
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  ALLOWED_HOSTS
  APPEND_SLASH
  AUTH_USER_MODEL
  BASE_URL
  CACHES
  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
  INSTALLED_APPS
  MEDIA_ROOT
  SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
  SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
  SESSION_COOKIE_PATH
  STATIC_URL
  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
  USE_I18N

For information on what these settings do, see `Django Settings <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/>`__.


URL Patterns
------------

.. code-block:: python

  from django.contrib import admin

  from wagtail.wagtailcore import urls as wagtail_urls
  from wagtail.wagtailadmin import urls as wagtailadmin_urls
  from wagtail.wagtaildocs import urls as wagtaildocs_urls
  from wagtail.wagtailsearch import urls as wagtailsearch_urls

  urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^django-admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

    url(r'^admin/', include(wagtailadmin_urls)),
    url(r'^search/', include(wagtailsearch_urls)),
    url(r'^documents/', include(wagtaildocs_urls)),

    # Optional URL for including your own vanilla Django urls/views
    url(r'', include('myapp.urls')),

    # For anything not caught by a more specific rule above, hand over to
    # Wagtail's serving mechanism
    url(r'', include(wagtail_urls)),
  ]

This block of code for your project's ``urls.py`` does a few things:

* Load the vanilla Django admin interface to ``/django-admin/``
* Load the Wagtail admin and its various apps
* Dispatch any vanilla Django apps you're using other than Wagtail which require their own URL configuration (this is optional, since Wagtail might be all you need)
* Lets Wagtail handle any further URL dispatching.

That's not everything you might want to include in your project's URL configuration, but it's what's necessary for Wagtail to flourish.
