Upgrade considerations
======================


Signals custom ``Image`` and ``Rendition`` models connected automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your are using a custom ``Image`` and ``Rendtion`` model, you need to remove the signal receivers, since they're connected automatically now.

Remove the following code

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete the source image file when an image is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Delete the rendition image file when a rendition is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomRendition)
    def rendition_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)
