Upgrade considerations
======================

``wagtail.wagtailimages.models.get_image_model`` has moved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``get_image_model`` function should now be imported from ``wagtail.wagtailimages`` rather than ``wagtail.wagtailimages.models``. See :ref:`custom_image_model_referring_to_image_model`.
