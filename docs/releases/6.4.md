## What's new

### Support for background tasks using `django-tasks`

Wagtail now integrates with the [django-tasks](https://github.com/realOrangeOne/django-tasks) library to allow moving computationally-intensive tasks out of the request-response cycle, and improving the performance of the Wagtail admin interface. These tasks include:

 * Updating the [search index](wagtailsearch_indexing)
 * Updating or creating entries for the [reference index](managing_the_reference_index)
 * Calculating [image focal points](image_focal_points)
 * Purging [frontend caching](frontend_cache_purging) URLs
 * Deleting image and document files when the model is deleted

In the default configuration, these tasks are executed immediately within the request-response cycle, as they were in previous versions of Wagtail. However, by configuring the `TASKS` setting with an appropriate backend [as per the django-tasks documentation](https://github.com/realOrangeOne/django-tasks?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), these tasks can be deferred to a background worker process.

This feature was developed by Jake Howard.

### Previews for StreamField blocks

You can now set up previews for StreamField blocks. The preview will be shown in the block picker, along with a description for the block. This feature can help users choose the right block when writing content inside a StreamField. To enable this feature, see [](configuring_block_previews).

This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah and Thibaud Colas.

### Headless documentation

The new [](headless) documentation page curates important information about Wagtail’s headless capabilities, directly within the developer documentation. This is the foundation for a [headless improvements roadmap](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/100) for Wagtail.

Thank you to Sævar Öfjörð Magnússon and Alex Fulcher for creating this new page at the Wagtail Space NL 2024 sprint.

### Alt text improvements

Building upon improvements in past versions, this release comes with further enhancements to alt text management:

 * The [content modeling accessibility considerations](content_modeling) now reflect the latest capabilities for alt text.
 * The new `ImageBlock` alt text is now populated from the image’s default alt text when selecting a new image.
 * The `ImageBlock` alt text field is also populated from the image’s default alt text when converting from an ImageChooserBlock.
 * Alt text quality is now checked by default, as was intended with the `alt-text-quality` content check.

Thank you to Matt Westcott, Thibaud Colas, and Cynthia Kiser for their work on these improvements.

### Shorthand for `FieldPanel` and `InlinePanel`

Plain strings can now be used in panel definitions as a substitute for `FieldPanel` and `InlinePanel`, avoiding the need to import these classes from `wagtail.admin.panels`:

```python
class MyPage(Page):
    body = RichTextField()
    content_panels = [
        'body',
    ]
```

This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.

### Drag-and-drop support for StreamField and InlinePanel

The StreamField and InlinePanel interfaces now support drag-and-drop reordering of items within a field. This makes it faster to rearrange content within these fields, particularly when there is a lot of content.

This feature was developed by Thibaud Colas and Sage Abdullah, thanks to a sponsorship by Lyst.

### Search terms report

For users of [promoted search results](editors_picks), a new search terms report is available in the admin interface.
This report shows terms that website users have searched for, and how many times they have been searched.
This can help you understand what your users are looking for, and adjust your search promotions accordingly.

This feature was developed by Noah van der Meer and Sage Abdullah.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` update

It's recommended that all projects set the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting to 10000 or higher.

This specifies the maximum number of fields allowed in a form submission, and it is recommended to increase this from Django's default of 1000, as particularly complex page models can exceed this limit within Wagtail's page editor:

```python
# settings.py
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 10_000
```

### Form builder - validation of fields with custom `related_name`

On previous releases, form page models (defined through `AbstractEmailForm`, `AbstractForm`, `FormMixin` or `EmailFormMixin`) did not validate form fields where the `related_name` was different to the default value of `form_fields`. As a result, it was possible to create forms with duplicate field names - in this case, only a single field is displayed and captured in the resulting form.

In this new release, validation is now applied on these fields, existing forms will continue to behave as before and no data will be lost. However, editing them will now raise a validation error and users may need to delete any duplicated fields that they had previously missed.

### Background tasks run at end of current transaction

```{note}
The behaviour described here no longer applies as of `django-tasks` 0.10. Tasks are now enqueued immediately (and executed immediately if `ImmediateBackend` is in use), and the `ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT` setting is no longer available.
```

In the default configuration, tasks managed by `django-tasks` (see above) run during the request-response cycle, as before. However, they are now deferred until the current transaction (if any) is committed. If [`ATOMIC_REQUESTS`](inv:django:std:setting#DATABASE-ATOMIC_REQUESTS) is set to `True`, this will be at the end of the request. This may lead to a change of behaviour on views that expect to see the results of these tasks immediately, such as a view that creates a page and then performs a search query to retrieve it. To restore the previous behaviour, set `"ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT": False` in the `TASKS` setting:

```python
# settings.py
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend",
        "ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT": False,
    }
}
```

Django's test framework typically runs tests inside transactions, and so this situation is also likely to arise in tests that perform database updates and then - within the same test - expect these changes to be immediately reflected in search queries, object usage counts, and other processes that are now handled with background tasks. This can be addressed by setting `ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT` to `False` as above in the test settings, or by wrapping the database updates in `with self.captureOnCommitCallbacks(execute=True)` to ensure that these tasks are completed before the test continues:

```python
def test_search(self):
    home_page = Page.objects.get(slug="home")

    with self.captureOnCommitCallbacks(execute=True):  # Added
        home_page.add_child(instance=EventPage(title="Christmas party"))

    response = self.client.get("/search/?q=Christmas")
    self.assertContains(response, "Christmas party")
```

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Added `page` as a third parameter to the `construct_wagtail_userbar` hook

In previous releases, implementations of the [`construct_wagtail_userbar`](construct_wagtail_userbar) hook were expected to accept two arguments, whereas now `page` is passed in as a third argument.

**Old**

```python
@hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
def construct_wagtail_userbar(request, items):
    pass
```

**New**

```python
@hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
def construct_wagtail_userbar(request, items, page):
    pass
```

The old style will now produce a deprecation warning.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Changes to `content_panels`, `promote_panels` and `settings_panels` values on base `Page` model

Previously, the `content_panels`, `promote_panels` and `settings_panels` attributes on the base `Page` model were defined as lists of `Panel` instances. These lists now contain instances of `wagtail.models.PanelPlaceholder` instead, which are resolved to `Panel` instances at runtime. Panel definitions that simply extend these lists (such as `content_panels = Page.content_panels + [...]`) are unaffected; however, any logic that inspects these lists (for example, finding a panel in the list to insert a new one immediately after it) will need to be updated to handle the new object types.

### Removal of unused Rangy JS library

The unused JavaScript include `wagtailadmin/js/vendor/rangy-core.js` has been removed from the editor interface, and functions such as `window.rangy.getSelection()` are no longer available. Any code relying on this should now either supply its own copy of the [Rangy library](https://github.com/timdown/rangy), or be migrated to the official [`Document.createRange()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) browser API.

### Deprecation of `window.buildExpandingFormset` global function

The undocumented global function `window.buildExpandingFormset` to attach JavaScript insertion / deletion behavior for Django formsets has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Within the Wagtail admin this only impacts a small set of basic expanding formsets in use across Workflow and Group view editing. `InlinePanel` is not affected.

Previously these expanding formsets required a mix of specific id attribute structures and inline scripts to instantiate with callbacks for handling deletion. User code implementing this functionality through `buildExpandingFormset` should be updated - the following data attributes can be used to emulate the same behavior. These are likely to change and should not be considered official documentation.

| Element                                      | Attribute(s)                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Containing element                           | `data-controller="w-formset"`             |
| Element to append new child forms            | `data-w-formset-target="forms"`           |
| Child form element                           | `data-w-formset-target="child"`           |
| Deleted form element                         | `data-w-formset-target="deleted" hidden`  |
| `template` element for blank form            | `data-w-formset-target="template"`        |
| Management field (total forms)               | `data-w-formset-target="totalFormsInput"` |
| Management field (min forms)                 | `data-w-formset-target="minFormsInput"`   |
| Management field (max forms)                 | `data-w-formset-target="maxFormsInput"`   |
| Management field (Delete, within child form) | `data-w-formset-target="deleteInput"`     |
| Add child `button`                           | `data-action="w-formset#add"`             |
| Delete child `button` (within child form)    | `data-action="w-formset#delete"`          |

Usage of nested id structures are no longer required but can be left in place for easier debugging.
