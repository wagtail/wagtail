## Upgrade considerations

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Deprecation of `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers

The undocumented usage of the JavaScript `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers will be removed in a future release.

The following `chooserUrl` object values will be impacted.

-   `anchorLinkChooser`
-   `documentChooser`
-   `emailLinkChooser`
-   `embedsChooser`
-   `externalLinkChooser`
-   `imageChooser`
-   `pageChooser`

Overriding these inner values on the global `window.chooserUrls` object will still override their usage in the Draftail choosers for now but this capability will be removed in a future release.

#### Example

It's recommended that usage of this global is removed in any customisations or third party packages and instead a custom Draftail Entity be used instead. See example below.

##### Old

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

@hooks.register("insert_editor_js")
def editor_js():
    return format_html(
        """
        <script>
            window.chooserUrls.myCustomChooser = '{0}';
        </script>
        """,
        reverse("myapp_chooser:choose"),
    )
```

##### New

Remove the `insert_editor_js` hook usage and instead pass the data needed via the Entity's data.

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

from django.urls import reverse_lazy

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def register_my_custom_feature(features):
    # features.register_link_type...

    features.register_editor_plugin(
        "draftail",
        "custom-link",
        draftail_features.EntityFeature(
            {
                "type": "CUSTOM_ITEM",
                "icon": "doc-full-inverse",
                "description": gettext_lazy("Item"),
                "chooserUrls": {
                    # Important: `reverse_lazy` must be used unless the URL path is hard-coded
                    "myChooser": reverse_lazy("myapp_chooser:choose")
                },
            },
            js=["..."],
        ),
    )

```

#### Overriding existing `chooserUrls` values

To override existing chooser Entities' `chooserUrls` values, here is an example of an unsupported monkey patch can achieve a similar goal.

However, it's recommended that a [custom Entity be created](creating_new_draftail_editor_entities) to be registered as a replacement feature for Draftail customisations as per the documentation.

```py
# .../wagtail_hooks.py
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

from wagtail import hooks

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def override_embed_feature_url(features):
    features.plugins_by_editor["draftail"]["embed"].data["chooserUrls"]["embedsChooser"] = reverse_lazy("my_embeds:chooser")
```
