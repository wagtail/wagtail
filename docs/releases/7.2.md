## What's new

### Reordering support for `ModelViewSet` and `SnippetViewSet` listing view

The listing view of {class}`~.ModelViewSet` and {class}`~.SnippetViewSet` now supports reordering of items using drag-and-drop. This feature can be enabled by setting the name of an integer field used for custom ordering as the {attr}`~.ModelViewSet.sort_order_field` attribute on the viewset or on the model. This feature was developed by Joey Jurjens and Sage Abdullah.

### Other features

 * Add usage count filter to the admin image and document listings (Joel William)
 * Add keyboard shortcut (`?`) to activate the keyboard shortcuts dialog (Dhruvi Patel)
 * Add keyboard shortcut (`/`) to activate and focus on the search input in the sidebar (Dhruvi Patel)
 * Allow deep contentpath for comments on fields other than StreamField (Lasse Schmieding, SÃ©bastien Corbin, Joel William, Sage Abdullah)
 * Reorganize keyboard shortcuts into better categories with an ordering from most common to most specific (Dhruvi Patel)

 * Prevent error when iterating over specific tasks with missing models (Lasse Schmieding)

### File title generation in document and image uploads now uses SyncController

The JavaScript code previously used to generate the title from the file name when uploading images or documents has been replaced with a Stimulus [`SyncController`](controller:SyncController) implementation. This change improves compliance with Content Security Policy (CSP) by avoiding the need for inline scripts.

The events described in [images title generation on upload](images_title_generation_on_upload) and [documents title generation on upload](docs_title_generation_on_upload) still continue to work as before. However, they may be deprecated in a future release in favor of the events dispatched by the `SyncController` with the `w-sync` prefix.

The use of `creationFormFileFieldSelector`, `creationFormTitleFieldSelector`, `creationFormEventName` options in `ChooserModalOnloadHandlerFactory` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
