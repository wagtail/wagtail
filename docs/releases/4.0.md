## What's new

### Other features

 * Add clarity to confirmation when being asked to convert an external link to an internal one (Thijs Kramer)
 * Convert various pages in the documentation to Markdown (Daniel Kirkham)
 * Add `base_url_path` to `ModelAdmin` so that the default URL structure of app_label/model_name can be overridden (Vu Pham, Khanh Hoang)
 * Add `full_url` to the API output of `ImageRenditionField` (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Use `InlinePanel`'s label when available for field comparison label (Sandil Ranasinghe)
 * Drop support for Safari 13 by removing left/right positioning in favour of CSS logical properties (Thibaud Colas)
 * Use `FormData` instead of jQuery's `form.serialize` when editing documents or images just added so that additional fields can be better supported (Stefan Hammer)
 * Add informational Codecov status checks for GitHub CI pipelines (Tom Hu)

### Bug fixes

 * Fix issue where `ModelAdmin` index listings with export list enabled would show buttons with an incorrect layout (Josh Woodcock)

## Upgrade considerations

### `base_url_path` keyword argument added to AdminURLHelper

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` class now accepts a `base_url_path` keyword argument on its constructor. Custom subclasses of this class should be updated to accept this keyword argument.


### Dropped support for Safari 13

Safari 13 will no longer be officially supported as of this release, this deviates the current support for the last 3 version of Safari by a few months and was required to add better support for RTL languages.
