The Wagtail demo site
_____________________

The examples in this document are based on `Torchbox.com <https://torchbox.com>`_. However, the instructions are general enough as to be applicable to any Wagtail site.

For the purposes of this documentation we will be using the URL, **www.example.com**, to represent the root (homepage) of your website.

Logging in
__________

* The first port of call for an editor is the login page for the administrator interface.
* Access this by adding **/admin** onto the end of your root URL (e.g. ``www.example.com/admin``).
* Enter your username and password and click **Sign in**.
