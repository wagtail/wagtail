What's new
==========

New ``HelpPanel``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new panel type ``HelpPanel`` allows to easily add HTML within an edit form.
This new feature was developed by Kevin Chung.


Profile picture upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now upload profile pictures directly through the Account Settings menu, rather than using Gravatar. Gravatar is still used as a fallback if no profile picture has been uploaded directly; a new setting :ref:`WAGTAIL_GRAVATAR_PROVIDER_URL <wagtail_gravatar_provider_url>` has been added to specify an alternative provider, or disable the use of external avatars completely. This feature was developed by Daniel Chimeno, Pierre Geier and Matt Westcott.


API lookup by page path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API now includes an endpoint for finding pages by path; see :ref:`apiv2_finding_pages_by_path`. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.


User time zone setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now set their current time zone through the Account Settings menu, which will then be reflected in date / time fields throughout the admin (such as go-live / expiry dates). The list of available time zones can be configured via the :ref:`WAGTAIL_USER_TIME_ZONES <WAGTAIL_USER_TIME_ZONES>` setting. This feature was developed by David Moore.


Elasticsearch 6 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now supports Elasticsearch 6. See :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_elasticsearch` for configuration details. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Image format ``image_to_html`` method has been updated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal API for rich text image format objects (see :ref:`rich_text_image_formats`) has been updated; the ``Format.image_to_html`` method now receives the ``extra_attributes`` keyword argument as a dictionary of attributes, rather than a string. If you have defined any custom format objects that override this method, these will need to be updated.
