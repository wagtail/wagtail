Editing existing pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways that you can access the edit screen of an existing page:

* Clicking the title of the page in an `Explorer page <the_explorer_page.html>`_ or in `search results <using_search.html>`_.
* Clicking the *Edit* link below the title in either of the situations above.

* When editing an existing page the title of the page being edited is displayed at the top of the page.
* The current status of the page is displayed in the top-right.
* You can change the title of the page by clicking into the title field.
* When you are typing into a field, help text is often displayed on the right-hand side of the screen.
