## Upgrade considerations

### Search within chooser interfaces requires `AutocompleteField` for full functionality

In Wagtail 4.2, the search bar within snippet chooser interfaces (and custom choosers created via `ChooserViewSet`) returned results for partial word matches - for example, a search for "wagt" would return results containing "Wagtail" - if this was supported by the search backend in use, and at least one `AutocompleteField` was present in the model's `search_fields` definition. Otherwise, it would fall back to only matching on complete words. In Wagtail 5.0, this fallback behaviour was removed, and consequently a model with no `AutocompleteField`s in place would return no results.

As of Wagtail 5.1.2, the fallback behaviour has been restored. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that you add `AutocompleteField` to your models' `search_fields` definitions, to ensure that users can receive search results continuously as they type. For example:

```python
from wagtail.search import index
# ... other imports

@register_snippet
class MySnippet(index.Indexed, models.Model):
     search_fields = [
         index.SearchField("name"),
         index.AutocompleteField("name"),
     ]
```
