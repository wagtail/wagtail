Accessibility targets and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now has official accessibility support targets: we are aiming for compliance with `WCAG2.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/>`_, AA level. WCAG 2.1 is the international standard which underpins many national accessibility laws.

Wagtail isn’t fully compliant just yet, but we have made many changes to the admin interface to get there. We thank the UK Government (in particular the CMS team at the Department for International Trade), who commissioned many of these improvements.

Here are changes which should make Wagtail more usable for all users regardless of abilities:

* Increase font-size across the whole admin (Beth Menzies, Katie Locke)
* Improved text color contrast across the whole admin (Beth Menzies, Katie Locke)
* Added consistent focus outline styles across the whole admin (Thibaud Colas)
* Ensured the 'add child page' button displays when focused (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)

This release also contains many big improvements for screen reader users:

* Added more ARIA landmarks across the admin interface and welcome page for screen reader users to navigate the CMS more easily (Beth Menzies)
* Improved heading structure for screen reader users navigating the CMS admin (Beth Menzies, Helen Chapman)
* Make icon font implementation more screen-reader-friendly (Thibaud Colas)
* Removed buggy tab order customisations in the CMS admin (Jordan Bauer)
* Screen readers now treat page-level action dropdowns as navigation instead of menus (Helen Chapman)
* Fixed occurrences of invalid HTML across the CMS admin (Thibaud Colas)
* Add empty alt attributes to all images in the CMS admin (Andreas Bernacca)
* Fixed focus not moving to the pages explorer menu when open (Helen Chapman)

We’ve also had a look at how controls are labeled across the UI for screen reader users:

* Add image dimensions in image gallery and image choosers for screen reader users (Helen Chapman)
* Add more contextual information for screen readers in the explorer menu’s links (Helen Chapman)
* Make URL generator preview image alt translatable (Thibaud Colas)
* Screen readers now announce "Dashboard" for the main nav’s logo link instead of Wagtail’s version number (Thibaud Colas)
* Remove duplicate labels in image gallery and image choosers for screen reader users (Helen Chapman)
* Added a label to the modals’ “close” button for screen reader users (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Added labels to permission checkboxes for screen reader users (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Improve screen-reader labels for action links in page listing (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Add screen-reader labels for table headings in page listing (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Add screen reader labels for page privacy toggle, edit lock, status tag in page explorer & edit views (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Add screen-reader labels for dashboard summary cards (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)
* Add screen-reader labels for privacy toggle of collections (Helen Chapman, Katie Locke)

Again, this is still a work in progress – if you are aware of other existing accessibility issues, please do `open an issue <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccessibility>`_ if there isn’t one already.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Removed support for Python 3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.4 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.5 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

Icon font implementation changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The icon font implementation has been changed to be invisible for screen-reader users, by switching to using `Private Use Areas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas>`_ Unicode code points. All of the icon classes (``icon-user``, ``icon-search``, etc) should still work the same, except for two which have been removed because they were duplicates:

 * ``icon-picture`` is removed. Use ``icon-image`` instead (same visual).
 * ``icon-file-text-alt`` is removed. Use ``icon-doc-full`` instead (same visual).

For a list of all available icons, please see the :ref:`styleguide`.
