# Translations

Wagtail uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to translate the content for the admin interface. Our goal is to ensure that Wagtail can be used by those who speak many different languages. Translation of admin content is a great way to contribute without needing to know how to write code.

```{note}
For translations and internationalisation of content made with Wagtail see [](internationalisation).
```

## Translation workflow

Wagtail is localised (translated) using Django's [translation system](django:topics/i18n/translation) and the translations are provided to and managed by [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/), a web platform that helps organisations coordinate translation projects.

Translations from Transifex are only integrated into the repository at the time of a new release. When a release is close to being ready there will be a RC (Release Candidate) for the upcoming version and the translations will be exported to Transifex.

During this RC period, usually around two weeks, there will be a chance for all the translators to update and add new translations. We will also notify the `#translators` channel in the Wagtail Slack group at this time.

These new translations are imported into Wagtail for any subsequent RC and the final release. If translations reach a threshold of about 80%, languages are added to the default list of languages users can choose from.

### How to help out with translations

-   Join the Wagtail community on [Slack](https://wagtail.org/slack/)
-   Search through the channels to join the `#translator` channel and introduce yourself
-   Go to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
-   Click on start for free
-   Fill in your Username, Email and Password
-   Agree to the terms and conditions

## Marking strings for translation

In code, strings can be marked for translation with using Django's [translation system](django:topics/i18n/translation), using `gettext` or `gettext_lazy` in Python and `blocktranslate`, `translate`, and `_(" ")` in templates.

In both Python and templates, make sure to always use named placeholder. In addition, in Python, only use the printf style formatting. This is to ensure compatibility with Transifex and help translators in their work.

### Translations within Python

```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

# Do this: printf style + named placeholders
_("Page %(page_title)s with status %(status)s") % {"page_title": page.title, "status": page.status_string}

# Do not use anonymous placeholders
_("Page %s with status %s") % (page.title, page.status_string)
_("Page {} with status {}").format(page.title, page.status_string)

# Do not use positional placeholders
_("Page {0} with status {1}").format(page.title, page.status_string)

# Do not use new style
_("Page {page_title} with status {status}").format(page_title=page.title, status=page.status_string)

# Do not interpolate within the gettext call
_("Page %(page_title)s with status %(status)s" % {"page_title": page.title, "status": page.status_string})
_("Page {page_title} with status {status}".format(page_title=page.title, status=page.status_string))

# Do not use f-string
_(f"Page {page.title} with status {page.status_string}")
```

### Translations with templates

You can import `i18n` and then translate with the `translate`/`blocktranslate` template tags. You can also translate string literals passed as arguments to tags and filters by using the familiar `_()` syntax.

```html+django
{% extends "wagtailadmin/base.html" %}
{% load i18n %}
<!-- preliminary lines of code -->

<!-- Do this to use the translate tag. -->
{% translate "Any string of your choosing" %}

<!-- Do this to use the blocktranslate tag. -->
{% blocktranslate %}
    A multi-line translatable literal.
{% endblocktranslate %}

<!-- Do these to translate string literals passed to tags and filters. -->

{% some_tag _("Any string of your choosing") %}
{% some_tag arg_of_some_tag=_("Any string of your choosing") %}
{% some_tag value_of_some_tag|filter=_("Any string of your choosing") value|yesno:_("yes,no") %}

<!-- A typical example of when to use translation of string literals is -->
{% translate "example with literal" as var_name %}
{% some_tag arg_of_some_tag=var_name %}

<!-- If the variable is only ever used once, you could do this instead -->
{% some_tag arg_of_some_tag=_("example with literal") %}
```

**Note**: In Wagtail code, you might see `trans` and `blocktrans` instead of `translate` and `blocktranslate`.
This still works fine. `trans` and `blocktrans` were the tags earlier on in Django, but were replaced in [Django 3.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/i18n/translation/#translate-template-tag).
