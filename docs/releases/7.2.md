## What's new

### Python 3.14 support

This release adds formal support for Python 3.14.

### Reordering support for model and snippet listing views

The listing view of {class}`~.ModelViewSet` and {class}`~.SnippetViewSet` now supports reordering of items using drag-and-drop. This feature can be enabled by setting the name of an integer field used for ordering as the {attr}`~.ModelViewSet.sort_order_field` attribute on the viewset or on the model. This can be a custom field, or set va inheriting [Orderable](wagtail.models.Orderable).

Make sure to set default values for the sort order field on existing items before enabling this feature to avoid unexpected behavior. Here is an example: `BreadType.objects.all().update(sort_order=F('pk') - 1)`.

This feature was developed by Joey Jurjens and Sage Abdullah.

### Media listings improvements

Image choosers now support both grid and list layouts, with a new toggle for users to switch between the two. The new toggle has also been added to standalone image listings for consistency.

Thank you to Joel William for implementing this as part of the [Google Summer of Code program](https://wagtail.org/blog/four-contributors-for-gsoc-2025/), with support from Coen van der Kamp, Sage Abdullah, Thibaud Colas, Ben Enright.

### Readability score metric

Built-in [content checks](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/reference/content-checks/) now include a readability score, based on length of words and sentences in the page content. The content metrics also now provide an explainer panel detailing how they are calculated. This feature was developed by Thibaud Colas.

### Quick access to first validation error

Error messages for form validation errors now contain a "Go to the first error" shortcut button. This speeds up navigating to address error messages, particularly for forms split between multiple tabs, where the errors can be hard to locate. This feature was developed by Srishti Jaiswal and LB (Ben) Johnston.

### File title generation in document and image uploads now uses SyncController

The JavaScript code previously used to generate the title from the file name when uploading images or documents has been replaced with a Stimulus [`SyncController`](controller:SyncController) implementation. This change improves compliance with Content Security Policy (CSP) by avoiding the need for inline scripts.

The events described in [images title generation on upload](images_title_generation_on_upload) and [documents title generation on upload](docs_title_generation_on_upload) still continue to work as before. However, they may be deprecated in a future release in favor of the events dispatched by the `SyncController` with the `w-sync` prefix.

The use of `creationFormFileFieldSelector`, `creationFormTitleFieldSelector`, `creationFormEventName` options in `ChooserModalOnloadHandlerFactory` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
