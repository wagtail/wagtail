Upgrade considerations
======================

The ``search_fields`` attribute on models should now be set to a list
=====================================================================

On searchable models (eg, ``Page`` or custom ``Image`` models) the ``search_fields`` attribute should now be a list instead of a tuple.

For example, the following ``Page`` model:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + (
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        )

Should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        ...

        search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
            indexed.SearchField('body'),
        ]

To ease the burden on third-party modules, adding tuples to ``Page.search_fields`` will still work. But this backwards-compatibility fix will be removed in Wagtail 1.7.
