## IE11

Wagtail has officially removed support for the legacy Internet Explorer browser in 2.15.

-   In Wagtail 2.11 (LTS), there was be a warning message displayed on the Wagtail dashboard for IE11 users with administrator role.
-   In Wagtail 2.12, the message was displayed to all users regardless of their role.
-   In Wagtail 2.13 and 2.14, the message was displayed at the top of all pages.
-   Wagtail will no longer support IE11 as of version 2.15 and beyond, for any releases after 2.16 there will no longer be a warning to users.

If this affects you or your organisation, consider which alternative browsers you may be able to use.
Wagtail is fully compatible with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft’s replacement for Internet Explorer. You may consider using its [IE mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-ie-mode) to keep access to IE11-only sites, while other sites and apps like Wagtail can use modern browser capabilities.

## Assistive technologies
