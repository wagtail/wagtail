# Customising admin views for snippets

Additional customisations to the admin views for each snippet model can be achieved through a custom {class}`~SnippetViewSet` class. The `SnippetViewSet` is a subclass of {class}`.ModelViewSet`, with snippets-specific properties provided by default. Hence, it supports the same customisations provided by `ModelViewSet` such as customising the listing view (e.g. adding custom columns, filters), creating a custom menu item, and more.

Before proceeding, ensure that you register the snippet model using `register_snippet` as a function instead of a decorator, as described in [](wagtailsnippets_registering).

For demonstration, consider the following `Member` model and a `MemberFilterSet` class:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models
from wagtail.admin.filters import WagtailFilterSet


class Member(models.Model):
    class ShirtSize(models.TextChoices):
        SMALL = "S", "Small"
        MEDIUM = "M", "Medium"
        LARGE = "L", "Large"
        EXTRA_LARGE = "XL", "Extra Large"

    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    shirt_size = models.CharField(max_length=5, choices=ShirtSize.choices, default=ShirtSize.MEDIUM)

    def get_shirt_size_display(self):
        return self.ShirtSize(self.shirt_size).label

    get_shirt_size_display.admin_order_field = "shirt_size"
    get_shirt_size_display.short_description = "Size description"


class MemberFilterSet(WagtailFilterSet):
    class Meta:
        model = Member
        fields = ["shirt_size"]
```

And the following is the snippet's corresponding `SnippetViewSet` subclass:

```python
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.admin.ui.tables import UpdatedAtColumn
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet
from wagtail.snippets.views.snippets import SnippetViewSet

from myapp.models import Member, MemberFilterSet


class MemberViewSet(SnippetViewSet):
    model = Member
    icon = "user"
    list_display = ["name", "shirt_size", "get_shirt_size_display", UpdatedAtColumn()]
    list_per_page = 50
    copy_view_enabled = False
    inspect_view_enabled = True
    admin_url_namespace = "member_views"
    base_url_path = "internal/member"
    filterset_class = MemberFilterSet
    # alternatively, you can use the following instead of filterset_class
    # list_filter = ["shirt_size"]
    # or
    # list_filter = {"shirt_size": ["exact"], "name": ["icontains"]}

    edit_handler = TabbedInterface([
        ObjectList([FieldPanel("name")], heading="Details"),
        ObjectList([FieldPanel("shirt_size")], heading="Preferences"),
    ])

register_snippet(MemberViewSet)
```

(wagtailsnippets_icon)=

## Icon

You can define an {attr}`~.ViewSet.icon` attribute on the `SnippetViewSet` to specify the icon that is used across the admin for this snippet type. The `icon` needs to be [registered in the Wagtail icon library](../../advanced_topics/icons). If `icon` is not set, the default `"snippet"` icon is used.

## URL namespace and base URL path

The {attr}`~.ViewSet.url_namespace` property can be overridden to use a custom URL namespace for the URL patterns of the views. If unset, it defaults to `wagtailsnippets_{app_label}_{model_name}`. Meanwhile, overriding {attr}`~.ViewSet.url_prefix` allows you to customise the base URL path relative to the Wagtail admin URL. If unset, it defaults to `snippets/app_label/model_name`.

Similar URL customisations are also possible for the snippet chooser views through {attr}`~SnippetViewSet.chooser_admin_url_namespace`, {attr}`~SnippetViewSet.chooser_base_url_path`, {meth}`~SnippetViewSet.get_chooser_admin_url_namespace`, and {meth}`~SnippetViewSet.get_chooser_admin_base_path`.

## Listing view

You can customise the listing view to add custom columns, filters, pagination, etc. via various attributes available on the `SnippetViewSet`. Refer to [the listing view customisations for `ModelViewSet`](modelviewset_listing) for more details.

Additionally, you can customise the base queryset for the listing view by overriding the {meth}`~SnippetViewSet.get_queryset` method.

## Copy view

```{versionadded} 6.0

```

The copy view is enabled by default and will be accessible by users with the 'add' permission on the model. To disable it, set {attr}`~.ModelViewSet.copy_view_enabled` to `False`. Refer to [the copy view customisations for `ModelViewSet`](modelviewset_copy) for more details.

## Inspect view

The inspect view is disabled by default, as it's not often useful for most models. To enable it, set {attr}`~.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_enabled` to `True`. Refer to [the inspect view customisations for `ModelViewSet`](modelviewset_inspect) for more details.

(wagtailsnippets_templates)=

## Templates

Template customisations work the same way as for `ModelViewSet`, except that the {attr}`~.ModelViewSet.template_prefix` defaults to `wagtailsnippets/snippets/`. Refer to [the template customisations for `ModelViewSet`](modelviewset_templates) for more details.

## Menu item

By default, registering a snippet model will add a "Snippets" menu item to the sidebar menu. However, you can configure a snippet model to have its own top-level menu item in the sidebar menu by setting {attr}`~.ViewSet.add_to_admin_menu` to `True`. Refer to [the menu customisations for `ModelViewSet`](modelviewset_menu) for more details.

An example of a custom `SnippetViewSet` subclass with `add_to_admin_menu` set to `True`:

```python
from wagtail.snippets.views.snippets import SnippetViewSet


class AdvertViewSet(SnippetViewSet):
    model = Advert
    icon = "crosshairs"
    menu_label = "Advertisements"
    menu_name = "adverts"
    menu_order = 300
    add_to_admin_menu = True
```

Multiple snippet models can also be grouped under a single menu item using a {attr}`~SnippetViewSetGroup`. You can do this by setting the {attr}`~SnippetViewSet.model` attribute on the `SnippetViewSet` classes and then registering the `SnippetViewSetGroup` subclass instead of each individual model or viewset:

```python
from wagtail.snippets.views.snippets import SnippetViewSet, SnippetViewSetGroup


class AdvertViewSet(SnippetViewSet):
    model = Advert
    icon = "crosshairs"
    menu_label = "Advertisements"
    menu_name = "adverts"


class ProductViewSet(SnippetViewSet):
    model = Product
    icon = "desktop"
    menu_label = "Products"
    menu_name = "banners"


class MarketingViewSetGroup(SnippetViewSetGroup):
    items = (AdvertViewSet, ProductViewSet)
    menu_icon = "folder-inverse"
    menu_label = "Marketing"
    menu_name = "marketing"


# When using a SnippetViewSetGroup class to group several SnippetViewSet classes together,
# only register the SnippetViewSetGroup class. You do not need to register each snippet
# model or viewset separately.
register_snippet(MarketingViewSetGroup)
```

If all snippet models have their own menu items, the "Snippets" menu item will not be shown.

Various additional attributes are available to customise the viewset - see {class}`~SnippetViewSet`.
