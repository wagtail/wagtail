# Adding multiple items

A common feature of Wagtail is the ability to add more than one of a particular type of field or item. For example, you can add as many authors to a page as you wish.

![Authors block, with two Authors child items, each containing a People field. The first blockâ€™s controls to the right are highlighted in red](../../_static/images/screen25_multiple_items_open.png)

-   Whenever you see the "+ Add" button illustrated here with "Add author(s)", it means you can add multiple objects or items to a page. Clicking the icon will display the fields required for that piece of content. The image below demonstrates this with a _Author(s)_ items.
-   You can delete an individual item by pressing the trash can in the top-right.
-   You can add more items by clicking the Add button again.
-   You can reorder your multiple items using the up and down arrows. Doing this will affect the order in which they are displayed on the live page.
