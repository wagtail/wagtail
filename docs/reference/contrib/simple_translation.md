# Simple translation

The simple_translation module provides a user interface that allows users to copy pages and translatable snippets into another language.

-   Copies are created in the source language (not translated)
-   Copies of pages are in draft status

Content editors need to translate the content and publish the pages.

```{note}
Simple Translation is optional. It can be switched out by third-party packages. Like the more advanced [`wagtail-localize`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-localize).
```

## Basic configuration

Add `"wagtail.contrib.simple_translation"` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "wagtail.contrib.simple_translation",
]
```

Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the necessary permissions.

In the Wagtail admin, go to settings and give some users or groups the "Can submit translations" permission.

## Page tree synchronisation

Depending on your use case, it may be useful to keep the page trees in sync between different locales.

You can enable this feature by setting `WAGTAILSIMPLETRANSLATION_SYNC_PAGE_TREE` to `True`.

```python
WAGTAILSIMPLETRANSLATION_SYNC_PAGE_TREE = True
```

When this feature is turned on, every time an editor creates a page, Wagtail creates an alias for that page under the page trees of all the other locales.

For example, when an editor creates the page `"/en/blog/my-blog-post/"`, Wagtail creates an alias of that page at `"/fr/blog/my-blog-post/"` and `"/de/blog/my-blog-post/"`.
