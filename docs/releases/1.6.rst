 * The 'choices' field on the form builder no longer has a maximum length (Johannes Spielmann)
 * The wagtailimages.Filter model has been removed, and converted to a Python class instead (Gagaro)

Upgrade considerations
======================

Form builder ``FormField`` models require a migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``choices`` field on the ``wagtailforms.models.AbstractFormField`` model has been changed from a ``CharField`` to a ``TextField``, to allow it to be of unlimited length. If you are using the ``wagtailforms`` module in your project, you will need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations`` and ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading, in order to apply this change to your form page models.

``wagtailimages.Filter`` model has been removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``wagtailimages.Filter`` model has been removed, and replaced with a ``Filter`` class instead. This class can be imported from the same location as the model: ``wagtail.wagtailimages.models.Filter``. The ``Filter`` class has the same API as the ``Filter`` model did, with the exception that Model methods such as ``Filter.save()``, and ``Filter.objects.get()`` have been removed.

``TagSearchable`` needs removing from custom image / document model migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mixin class ``wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable``, used internally by image and document models, has been deprecated. If you are using custom image or document models in your project, the migration(s) which created them will contain frozen references to ``wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable``, which must now be removed. The line:

.. code-block:: python

    import wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable

should be replaced by:

.. code-block:: python

    import wagtail.wagtailsearch.index

and the line:

.. code-block:: python

    bases=(models.Model, wagtail.wagtailadmin.taggable.TagSearchable),

should be updated to:

.. code-block:: python

    bases=(models.Model, wagtail.wagtailsearch.index.Indexed),
