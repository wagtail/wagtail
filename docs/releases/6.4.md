## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` update

It's recommended that all projects set the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS` setting to 10000 or higher.

This specifies the maximum number of fields allowed in a form submission, and it is recommended to increase this from Django's default of 1000, as particularly complex page models can exceed this limit within Wagtail's page editor:

```python
# settings.py
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 10_000
```

### Form builder - validation of fields with custom `related_name`

On previous releases, form page models (defined through `AbstractEmailForm`, `AbstractForm`, `FormMixin` or `EmailFormMixin`) did not validate form fields where the `related_name` was different to the default value of `form_fields`. As a result, it was possible to create forms with duplicate field names - in this case, only a single field is displayed and captured in the resulting form. As of Wagtail 6.4, validation is now applied on these fields. Existing forms will continue to behave as before and no data will be lost, but editing them will now raise a validation error.

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Added `page` as a third parameter to the `construct_wagtail_userbar` hook

In previous releases, implementations of the [`construct_wagtail_userbar`](construct_wagtail_userbar) hook were expected to accept two arguments, whereas now `page` is passed in as a third argument.

**Old**

```python
@hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
def construct_wagtail_userbar(request, items):
    pass
```

**New**

```python
@hooks.register('construct_wagtail_userbar')
def construct_wagtail_userbar(request, items, page):
    pass
```

The old style will now produce a deprecation warning.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Removal of unused Rangy JS library

The unused JavaScript include `wagtailadmin/js/vendor/rangy-core.js` has been removed from the editor interface, and functions such as `window.rangy.getSelection()` are no longer available. Any code relying on this should now either supply its own copy of the [Rangy library](https://github.com/timdown/rangy), or be migrated to the official [`Document.createRange()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) browser API.

### Deprecation of `window.buildExpandingFormset` global function

The undocumented global function `window.buildExpandingFormset` to attach JavaScript insertion / deletion behavior for Django formsets has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Within the Wagtail admin this only impacts a small set of basic expanding formsets in use across Workflow and Group view editing. `InlinePanel` is not affected.

Previously these expanding formsets required a mix of specific id attribute structures and inline scripts to instantiate with callbacks for handling deletion. User code implementing this functionality through `buildExpandingFormset` should be updated - the following data attributes can be used to emulate the same behavior. These are likely to change and should not be considered official documentation.

| Element                                      | Attribute(s)                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Containing element                           | `data-controller="w-formset"`             |
| Element to append new child forms            | `data-w-formset-target="forms"`           |
| Child form element                           | `data-w-formset-target="child"`           |
| Deleted form element                         | `data-w-formset-target="deleted" hidden`  |
| `template` element for blank form            | `data-w-formset-target="template"`        |
| Management field (total forms)               | `data-w-formset-target="totalFormsInput"` |
| Management field (min forms)                 | `data-w-formset-target="minFormsInput"`   |
| Management field (max forms)                 | `data-w-formset-target="maxFormsInput"`   |
| Management field (Delete, within child form) | `data-w-formset-target="deleteInput"`     |
| Add child `button`                           | `data-action="w-formset#add"`             |
| Delete child `button` (within child form)    | `data-action="w-formset#delete"`          |

Usage of nested id structures are no longer required but can be left in place for easier debugging.
