What's new
==========

Search query expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search queries can now be constructed as structured expressions in the manner of the Django ORM's ``Q()`` values, allowing for complex queries that combine individual terms, phrases and boosting. A helper function ``parse_query_string`` is provided to convert "natural" queries containing quoted phrases into these expressions. For complete documentation, see :ref:`wagtailsearch_complex_queries`. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley and sponsored by `The Motley Fool <https://www.fool.com/>`_.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Removed support for Python 3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.5 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.6 or above before upgrading Wagtail.


``<div class="rich-text">`` wrappers removed from rich text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous releases, rich text values were enclosed in a ``<div class="rich-text">`` element when rendered; this element has now been removed.
To restore the old behaviour, see :ref:`legacy_richtext`.
