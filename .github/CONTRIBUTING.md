# Contributing to Wagtail

Thank you for considering to help Wagtail.

We welcome all support, whether on bug reports, code, design, reviews, tests,
documentation, translations or just feature requests.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features requests](#features)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). Please don't use the issue tracker
for support - use [the 'wagtail' tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wagtail) (preferred) or our [Wagtail support group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wagtail).

## Code reviews

We welcome code reviews from everyone. There's always a list of pull requests tagged ['Needs review'](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Needs+review%22).
