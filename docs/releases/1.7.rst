What's new
==========


Elasticsearch 2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now supports Elasticsearch 2. Note that you need to change backend in ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS``, if you wish to switch to Elasticsearch 2. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_elasticsearch`


AWS CloudFront support added to cache invalidation module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail's cache invalidation module can now invalidate pages cached in AWS CloudFront when they are updated or unpublished.
This feature was developed by Rob Moorman.

See: :ref:`frontendcache_aws_cloudfront`


Unpublishing subpages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpublishing a page now gives the option to unpublish its subpages at the same time. This feature was developed by Jordi Joan.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``|embed`` filter has been converted into a templatetag ``{% embed %}`` (Janneke Janssen)
 * The ``wagtailforms`` module now provides a ``FormSubmissionPanel`` for displaying details of form submissions; see :ref:`wagtailforms_formsubmissionpanel` for documentation. (João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * The Wagtail version number can now be obtained as a tuple using ``from wagtail import VERSION`` (Tim Heap)
 * ``send_mail`` logic has been moved from ``AbstractEmailForm.process_form_submission`` into ``AbstractEmailForm.send_mail``. Now it's easier to override this logic (Tim Leguijt)
 * Added ``before_create_page``, ``before_edit_page``, ``before_delete_page`` hooks (Karl Hobley)
 * Updated font sizes and colours to improve legibility of admin menu and buttons (Stein Strindhaug)
 * Added pagination to "choose destination" view when moving pages (Nick Smith, Žan Anderle)
 * Added ability to annotate search results with score - see :ref:`wagtailsearch_annotating_results_with_score` (Karl Hobley)
 * Added ability to limit access to form submissions - see :ref:`filter_form_submissions_for_user` (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Added the ability to configure the number of days search logs are kept for, through the :ref:`WAGTAILSEARCH_HITS_MAX_AGE <wagtailsearch_hits_max_age>` setting (Stephen Rice)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Migrations for wagtailcore and project template are now reversible (Benjamin Bach)
 * Migrations no longer depend on wagtailcore and taggit's ``__latest__`` migration, logically preventing those apps from receiving new migrations (Matt Westcott)
 * The default image format label text ('Full width', 'Left-aligned', 'Right-aligned') is now localised (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Text on the front-end 'password required' form is now marked for translation (Janneke Janssen)
 * Text on the page view restriction form is now marked for translation (Luiz Boaretto)
 * Fixed toggle behaviour of userbar on mobile (Robert Rollins)
 * Image rendition / document file deletion now happens on a post_delete signal, so that files are not lost if the deletion does not proceed (Janneke Janssen)
 * "Your recent edits" list on dashboard no longer leaves out pages that another user has subsequently edited (Michael Cordover, Kees Hink, João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * ``InlinePanel`` now accepts a ``classname`` parameter as per the documentation (emg36, Matt Westcott)
 * Disabled use of escape key to revert content of rich text fields, which could cause accidental data loss (Matt Westcott)
 * Setting ``USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR = True`` no longer breaks the rendering of numbers in JS code for InlinePanel (Mattias Loverot, Matt Westcott)


Upgrade considerations
======================

Project template's initial migration should not depend on ``wagtailcore.__latest__``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On projects created under previous releases of Wagtail, the ``home/migrations/0001_initial.py`` migration created by the ``wagtail start`` command contains the following dependency line:

.. code-block:: python

    dependencies = [
        ('wagtailcore', '__latest__'),
    ]

This may produce ``InconsistentMigrationHistory`` errors under Django 1.10 when upgrading Wagtail, since Django interprets this to mean that no new migrations can legally be added to wagtailcore after this migration is applied. This line should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    dependencies = [
        ('wagtailcore', '0029_unicode_slugfield_dj19'),
    ]


Non-administrators now need 'bulk delete' permission to delete pages with children
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a precaution against accidental data loss, this release introduces a new "bulk delete" permission on pages, which can be set through the Settings -> Groups area. Non-administrator users must have this permission in order to delete pages that have children; a user without this permission would have to delete each child individually before deleting the parent. By default, no groups are assigned this new permission. If you wish to restore the previous behaviour, and don't want to configure permissions manually through the admin interface, you can do so with a data migration. Create an empty migration using ``./manage.py makemigrations myapp --empty --name assign_bulk_delete_permission`` (replacing ``myapp`` with the name of one of your project's apps) and edit the migration file to contain the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import unicode_literals

    from django.db import migrations


    def add_bulk_delete_permission(apps, schema_editor):
        """Find all groups with add/edit page permissions, and assign them bulk_delete permission"""
        GroupPagePermission = apps.get_model('wagtailcore', 'GroupPagePermission')
        for group_id, page_id in GroupPagePermission.objects.filter(
            permission_type__in=['add', 'edit']
        ).values_list('group', 'page').distinct():
            GroupPagePermission.objects.create(
                group_id=group_id, page_id=page_id, permission_type='bulk_delete'
            )


    def remove_bulk_delete_permission(apps, schema_editor):
        GroupPagePermission = apps.get_model('wagtailcore', 'GroupPagePermission')
        GroupPagePermission.objects.filter(permission_type='bulk_delete').delete()


    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        dependencies = [
            # keep the original dependencies line
        ]

        operations = [
            migrations.RunPython(add_bulk_delete_permission, remove_bulk_delete_permission),
        ]


.. _filter_spec_migration:

Custom image models require a data migration for the new ``filter_spec`` field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data model for image renditions will be changed in Wagtail 1.8 to eliminate ``Filter`` as a model. Wagtail sites using a custom image model (see :ref:`custom_image_model`) need to have a schema and data migration in place prior to upgrading to Wagtail 1.8. To create these migrations:

 * Run ``manage.py makemigrations`` to create the schema migration
 * Run ``manage.py makemigrations --empty myapp`` (replacing ``myapp`` with the name of the app containing the custom image model) to create an empty migration
 * Edit the created migration to contain::

    from wagtail.wagtailimages.utils import get_fill_filter_spec_migrations

   and, for the ``operations`` list::

    forward, reverse = get_fill_filter_spec_migrations('myapp', 'CustomRendition')
    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(forward, reverse),
    ]

   replacing ``myapp`` and ``CustomRendition`` with the app and model name for the custom rendition model.
