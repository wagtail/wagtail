What's changed
==============

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``wagtailfrontendcache`` no longer tries to purge pages that are not in a site
* The contents of ``<div>`` elements in the rich text editor were not being whitelisted
* Due to the above issue, embeds/images in a rich text field would sometimes be saved into the database in their editor representation
* RoutablePage now prevents ``subpage_urls`` from being defined as a property, which would cause a memory leak
