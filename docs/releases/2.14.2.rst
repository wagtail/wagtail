Upgrade considerations
======================

Customising relation name for admin comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The admin commenting feature introduced in Wagtail 2.13 added a relation named ``comments`` to the Page and User
models. This can cause conflicts with third-party apps that implement commenting functionality, and so this will be
renamed to ``wagtail_admin_comments`` in Wagtail 2.15. Developers who are affected by this issue, and have thus been
unable to upgrade to Wagtail 2.13 or above, can now "opt in" to the Wagtail 2.15 behaviour by adding the following
line to their project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAIL_COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME = 'wagtail_admin_comments'

This will allow third-party commenting apps to work in Wagtail 2.14.2 alongside Wagtail's admin commenting functionality.

Reusable library code that needs to preserve backwards compatibility with previous Wagtail versions
can find out the relation name as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        from wagtail.core.models import COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME
    except ImportError:
        COMMENTS_RELATION_NAME = 'comments'
