## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Specifying a dict of distribution IDs for CloudFront cache invalidation is deprecated

Previous versions allowed passing a dict for `DISTRIBUTION_ID` within the `WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE` configuration for a CloudFront backend, to allow specifying different distribution IDs for different hostnames. This is now deprecated; instead, multiple distribution IDs should be defined as [multiple backends](frontendcache_multiple_backends), with a `HOSTNAMES` parameter to define the hostnames associated with each one. For example, a configuration such as:

```python
WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
    'cloudfront': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': {
            'www.wagtail.org': 'your-distribution-id',
            'www.madewithwagtail.org': 'other-distribution-id',
        },
    },
}
```

should now be rewritten as:

```python
WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
    'mainsite': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': 'your-distribution-id',
        'HOSTNAMES': ['www.wagtail.org'],
    },
    'madewithwagtail': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': 'other-distribution-id',
        'HOSTNAMES': ['www.madewithwagtail.org'],
    },
}
```

### "Snippets" menu now only includes snippet models without menu items

The "Snippets" sidebar menu item appears if there are snippet models [without their own menu items](wagtailsnippets_menu_item).
Previously, the "Snippets" menu item pointed to a snippets index view that listed all snippet models whether they'd been configured with their own menu items or not.
This behaviour has been changed and the snippets index view will now only include snippet models that haven't been configured that way.

The new [](wagtailsnippets_menu_show_all) setting can be used to always show a top-level "Snippets" menu item in the sidebar pointing to an index view that includes all snippet models.
