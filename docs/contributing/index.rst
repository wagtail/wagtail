Contributing to Wagtail
=======================

Issues
~~~~~~

The easiest way to contribute to Wagtail is to tell us how to improve it! First, check to see if your bug or feature request has already been submitted at `github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues>`_. If it has, and you have some supporting information which may help us deal with it, comment on the existing issue. If not, please `create a new one <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/new>`_, providing as much relevant context as possible. For example, if you're experiencing problems with installation, detail your environment and the steps you've already taken. If something isn't displaying correctly, tell us what browser you're using, and include a screenshot if possible.

If your bug report is a security issue, **do not** report it with an issue. Please read our â€‹guide to :doc:`reporting security issues <security>`.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a Python or Django developer, `fork it <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/>`_ and read the :ref:`developing docs <developing>` to get stuck in! We welcome all contributions, whether they solve problems which are specific to you or they address existing issues. If you're stuck for ideas, pick something from the `issue list <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?state=open>`_, or email us directly on `hello@wagtail.io <mailto:hello@wagtail.io>`_ if you'd like us to suggest something!

For large-scale changes, we'd generally recommend breaking them down into smaller pull requests that achieve a single well-defined task and can be reviewed individually. If this isn't possible, we recommend opening a pull request on the `Wagtail RFCs <https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/>`_ repository, so that there's a chance for the community to discuss the change before it gets implemented.
