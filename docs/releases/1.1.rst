What's new
==========

``specific()`` method on PageQuerySet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually, an operation that retrieves a queryset of pages (such as ``homepage.get_children()``) will return them as basic Page instances, which only include the core page data such as title. The ``specific()`` method (e.g. ``homepage.get_children().specific()``) now allows them to be retrieved as their most specific type, using the minimum number of queries.

"Promoted search results" has moved into its own module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, this was implemented in :mod:`~wagtail.wagtailsearch` but now has
been moved into a separate module: :mod:`wagtail.contrib.wagtailsearchpromotions`

Atomic rebuilding of Elasticsearch indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Elasticsearch search backend now accepts an experimental ``ATOMIC_REBUILD`` flag which ensures that the existing search index continues to be available while the ``update_index`` task is running. See :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_atomic_rebuild`.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The :mod:`~wagtail.contrib.wagtailapi` module has been refactored to use Django REST Framework
 * Implemented pagination in the page chooser modal
 * Changed INSTALLED_APPS in project template to list apps in precedence order
 * The ``{% image %}`` tag now supports filters on the image variable, e.g. ``{% image primary_img|default:secondary_img width-500 %}``
 * Moved the style guide menu item into the Settings sub-menu
 * Search backends can now be specified by module (e.g. ``wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch``), rather than a specific class (``wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch.ElasticSearch``)
 * Added ``descendant_of`` filter to the API
 * Added optional directory argument to "wagtail start" command
 * Non-superusers can now view/edit/delete sites if they have the correct permissions
 * Image file size is now stored in the database, to avoid unnecessary filesystem lookups
 * Page URL lookups hit the cache/database less often
 * Updated URLs within the admin backend to use namespaces
 * The ``update_index`` task now indexes objects in batches of 1000, to indicate progress and avoid excessive memory use

Permissions fixes in the admin interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of inconsistencies around permissions in the admin interface were fixed in this release:

 * Removed all permissions for "User profile" (not used)
 * Removed "delete" permission for Images and documents (not used)
 * Users can now access images and documents when they only have the "change" permission (previously required "add" permission as well)
 * Permissions for Users now taken from custom user model, if set (previously always used permissions on Djangos builtin User model)
 * Groups and Users now respond consistently to their respective "add", "change" and "delete" permissions

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Text areas in the non-default tab of the page editor now resize to the correct height
 * Tabs in "insert link" modal in the rich text editor no longer disappear (Tim Heap)
 * H2 elements in rich text fields were accidentally given a click() binding when put insite a collapsible multi field panel


Upgrade considerations
======================

"Promoted search results" no longer in :mod:`~wagtail.wagtailsearch`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature has moved into a contrib module so is no longer enabled by default.

To re-enable it, add :mod:`wagtail.contrib.wagtailsearchpromotions` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...

        'wagtail.contrib.wagtailsearchpromotions',

        ...
