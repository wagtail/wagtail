Wagtail 1.12 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 8 months). Please note that Wagtail 1.12 will be the last LTS release to support Python 2.


What's new
==========

Improved embed configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New configuration options for embedded media have been added, to give greater control over how media URLs are converted to embeds, and to make it possible to specify additional media providers beyond the ones built in to Wagtail. For further information, see :ref:`embedded_content`. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The admin interface now displays a title of the latest draft (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Added multi-select form field to the form builder (dwasyl)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * FieldBlocks in StreamField now call the field's ``prepare_value`` method (Tim Heap)
 * Initial disabled state of InlinePanel add button is now set correctly on non-default tabs (Matthew Downey)
 * Redirects with unicode characters now work (Rich Brennan)
 * Prevent explorer view from crashing when page model definitions are missing, allowing the offending pages to be deleted (Matt Westcott)


Upgrade considerations
======================

Old configuration settings for embeds are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration settings ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBED_FINDER`` and ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBEDLY_KEY`` have been deprecated in favour of the new ``WAGTAILEMBEDS_FINDERS`` setting. Please see :ref:`configuring_embed_finders` for the new configuration to use.

Custom ``get_admin_display_title`` methods should use ``draft_title``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a new ``draft_title`` field on page models, so that page titles as used across the admin interface will correctly reflect any changes that exist in draft. If any of your page models override the ``get_admin_display_title`` method, to customise the display of page titles in the admin, it is recommended that you now update these to base their output on ``draft_title`` rather than ``title``. Alternatively, to preserve backwards compatibility, you can invoke ``super`` on the method, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_admin_display_title(self):
        return "%(title)s (%(lang)s)" % {
            'title': super(TranslatablePage, self).get_admin_display_title(),
            'lang': self.language_code,
        }
