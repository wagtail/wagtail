        Return a localized version of this queryset.

        A localized queryset is one where objects are replaced with versions translated
        into the active locale. Where a translation isn't available for an object, the
        original is retained instead. The resulting queryset will be of the same length
        as the original.

        This method is the queryset equivalent of the
        :py:attr:`.localized <wagtail.models.TranslatableMixin.localized>` property
        on the :py:class:`TranslatableMixin <wagtail.models.TranslatableMixin>`.

        By default, the same ordering definition as in the original queryset is applied.
        This means that the translated values are being considered during ordering,
        which can lead to a different order than the original queryset. If you want to
        preserve the same order as the original queryset, you need to pass
        ``preserve_order=True``.

        If a model inherits from
        :py:class:`DraftStateMixin <wagtail.models.DraftStateMixin>`,
        then a translation of an instance in the original queryset could exist, but
        be in a draft state (i.e. ``live=False``). By default, draft translations are
        not considered when compiling the translated instances and the original instance
        is used in the localized queryset. To override this behavior and allow draft
        translations in the localized queryset, pass
        ``include_draft_translations=True``. Regardless of this option, the resulting
        localized queryset will be the same length as the original.

        Note: The draft state of an original instance is not considered. I.e., if the
        original instance is in draft, its translation is also in draft and
        ``include_draft_translations=False`` is used, then the original instance will
        be used in the localized queryset (regardless of its draft state). To exclude
        original draft instances from the localized queryset, filter the original
        queryset to only include live instances.

        By default, the localized queryset can contain untranslated instances from the
        original queryset if no translation for the instance is available. If this is
        not desired, pass ``include_only_translations=True`` to only include instances
        that are translated into the active locale. In case not all instances are
        translated and ``include_draft_translations=True`` is passed, the resulting
        queryset will be shorter than the original.

        Note: If localization is disabled via the ``WAGTAIL_I18N_ENABLED`` setting, this
        method returns the original queryset unchanged.

        Note: Because this method returns a new queryset that is not a subset of the
        original queryset effects of methods like ``select_related`` and
        ``prefetch_related`` are not retained. If you want to use them on the resulting
        queryset, you should apply them after ``.localized()``.
