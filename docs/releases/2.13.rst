Upgrade considerations
======================

Updated handling of non-required StreamFields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rules for determining whether a StreamField is required (i.e. at least one block must be provided) have been simplified and made consistent with other field types. Non-required fields are now indicated by ``blank=True`` on the ``StreamField`` definition; the default is ``blank=False`` (the field is required). In previous versions, to make a field non-required, it was necessary to define :ref:`a top-level StreamBlock<streamfield_top_level_streamblock>` with ``required=False`` (which applied the validation rule) as well as setting ``blank=True`` (which removed the asterisk from the form field). You should review your use of StreamField to check that ``blank=True`` is used on the fields you wish to make optional.

Switched ``register_setting``, ``register_settings_menu_item`` to use SVG icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting menu items now use SVG icons by default. For sites reusing built-in Wagtail icons, no changes should be required. For sites using custom font icons, update the menu itemsâ€™ definition to use the ``classnames`` attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    # With register_setting,
    # Before:
    @register_setting(icon='custom-cog')
    # After:
    @register_setting(icon='', classnames='icon icon-custom-cog')

    # Or with register_settings_menu_item,
    @hooks.register('register_settings_menu_item')
    def register_frank_menu_item():
        # Before:
        return SettingMenuItem(CustomSetting, icon='custom-cog')
        # After:
        return SettingMenuItem(CustomSetting, icon='', classnames='icon icon-custom-cog')
