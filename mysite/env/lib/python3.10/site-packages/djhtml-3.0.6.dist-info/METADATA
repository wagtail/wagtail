# DjHTML

***A pure-Python Django/Jinja template indenter without dependencies.***

DjHTML indents mixed HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates that contain
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/)
or [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) template
tags. It works similar to other code-formatting tools such as
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and interoperates nicely with
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

DjHTML is an _indenter_ and not a _formatter_: it will only add/remove
whitespace at the beginning of lines. It will not insert newlines or
other characters. The goal is to correctly indent already
well-structured templates, not to fix broken ones.


### New! Multi-line HTML elements

As of version 3, DjHTML indents multi-line HTML elements and
multi-line attribute values like this:

```jinja
<blockquote cite="Guido Van Rossum"
            style="font-style: italic;
                   {% if dark_mode %}
                       background: black;
                   {% endif %}
                  ">
    Don't you hate code that's not properly indented?
</blockquote>
```


### New! Multi-line CSS indentation

Multi-line CSS values are now continued at the same indentation level:

```jinja
<style>
    @font-face {
        font-family: Helvetica;
        src: {% for format, filename in licensed_fonts %}
                 url('{% static filename %}') format('{{ format }}'),
             {% endfor %}
             url('Arial.woff2') format('woff2'),
             url('Arial.woff') format('woff');
    }
</style>
```


### New! Improved JavaScript indentation

Many new JavaScript indention rules have been added, such as the
indentation of method chaining:

```jinja
<script>
    window.fetch('/test.html')
        .then((html) => {
            document.body.innerHTML = html;
            {% block extra_statements %}
            {% endblock %}
        });
</script>
```


### New! Tabwidth guessing

Without the `-t` / `--tabwidth` argument, DjHTML no longer defaults to
a tabwidth of 4 but instead guesses the correct tabwidth.


## Installation

DjHTML requires Python 3.8 or higher and is compatible with all
operating systems supported by Python. Install DjHTML with the
following command:

    $ pip install djhtml

Note that
[Windows still uses legacy code pages](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#win-utf8-mode)
instead of UTF-8. It is highly advised to set the environment variable
`PYTHONUTF8` to `1` with the
[setx](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx)
command:

    C:\> setx /m PYTHONUTF8 1


## Usage

After installation you can indent templates using the `djhtml`
command:

    $ djhtml template.html
    reindented template.html
    1 template has been reindented.

You can also run `djhtml .` to indent all HTML files beneath the
current directory.

An exit status of 0 means that everything went well, regardless of
whether any files were changed. When the option `-c` / `--check` is
used, the exit status is 1 when one or more files would have changed,
but no changes are actually made. All available options are given by
`djthml -h` / `djthml --help`.


## `fmt:off` and `fmt:on`

You can exclude specific lines from being processed with the
`{# fmt:off #}` and `{# fmt:on #}` operators:

```jinja
{# fmt:off #}
   ,-._|\
  /     .\
  \_,--._/
{# fmt:on #}
```

Contents inside `<pre> ... </pre>`, `<!-- ... --->`, `/* ... */`, and
`{% comment %} ... {% endcomment %}` tags are also ignored (depending
on the current mode).


## Modes

The indenter operates in one of three different modes:

- DjHTML mode: the default mode. Invoked by using the `djhtml` command
  or the pre-commit hook.

- DjCSS mode. Will be entered when a `<style>` tag is encountered in
  DjHTML mode. It can also be invoked directly with the command
  `djcss`.

- DjJS mode. Will be entered when a `<script>` tag is encountered in
  DjHTML mode. It can also be invoked directly with the command
  `djjs`.


## pre-commit configuration

A great way to use DjHTML is as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
hook, so all your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files will automatically be
indented upon every commit.

First, install pre-commit:

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install

Then, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/rtts/djhtml
    rev: 'main'  # replace with the latest tag on GitHub
    hooks:
      - id: djhtml
      - id: djcss
      - id: djjs
```

Now run `pre-commit autoupdate` to automatically replace `main` with
the latest tag on GitHub,
[as recommended by pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#using-the-latest-version-for-a-repository).

If you want to override a command-line option, for example to change
the default tabwidth, you change the `entry` point of these hooks:

```yml
    hooks:
      - id: djhtml
        # Use a tabwidth of 2 for HTML files
        entry: djhtml --tabwidth 2
      - id: djcss
      - id: djjs
```

If you want to limit the files these hooks operate on, you can use
[pre-commit mechanisms for filtering](https://pre-commit.com/#filtering-files-with-types).
For example:

```yml
    hooks:
      - id: djhtml
        # Indent only HTML files in template directories
        files: .*/templates/.*\.html$
      - id: djcss
        # Run this hook only on SCSS files (CSS and SCSS is the default)
        types: [scss]
      - id: djjs
        # Exclude JavaScript files in vendor directories
        exclude: .*/vendor/.*
```

Now when you run `git commit` you will see something like the
following output:

    $ git commit

    DjHTML...................................................................Failed
    - hook id: djhtml
    - files were modified by this hook

    reindented template.html
    1 template has been reindented.

To inspect the changes that were made, use `git diff`. If you are
happy with the changes, you can commit them normally. If you are not
happy, please do the following:

1. Run `SKIP=djhtml git commit` to commit anyway, skipping the
   `djhtml` hook.

2. Consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml/issues)
   with the relevant part of the input file that was incorrectly
   formatted, and an example of how it should have been formatted.

Your feedback for improving DjHTML is very welcome!


## Development

First of all, clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/rtts/djhtml
    $ cd djhtml

Then, create a Python virtualenv and activate it:

    $ python -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djhtml
    $ . ~/.virtualenvs/djhtml/bin/activate

Then, install the package in [development
mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html)
including the `dev` dependencies, and install the pre-commit hooks:

    $ python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
    $ pre-commit install --install-hooks

You can run the unittests with:

    $ python -m unittest

Or use [`nox`](https://nox.thea.codes) to test all supported Python
interpreters:

    $ nox

Finally, to get a little insight into the tokenization step of the
indenting algorithm, you can run DjHTML with the `-d` / `--debug`
argument. You will see a Python representation of the tokens that are
created.
