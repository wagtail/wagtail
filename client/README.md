Wagtail includes a wide range of client-side components powered by Stimulus and other JavaScript libraries. These components can be used programmatically to build custom features and enhancements within the Wagtail admin interface. To assist advanced developers and third-party package maintainers, we automatically generate documentation for these components using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org).

Please note that some of these components may evolve rapidly and are not subject to the same stability guarantees outlined in our deprecation policy. If you make use of these components, ensure that you have a testing process that help you catch any breaking changes with each Wagtail upgrade.
