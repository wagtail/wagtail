What's new
==========

Django 1.9 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail is now compatible with Django 1.9.


Indexing fields across relations in Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields on related objects can now be indexed in Elasticsearch using the new ``indexed.RelatedFields`` declaration type:

.. code-block:: python

    class Book(models.Model, indexed.Indexed):
        ...

        search_fields = [
            indexed.SearchField('title'),
            indexed.FilterField('published_date'),

            indexed.RelatedFields('author', [
                indexed.SearchField('name'),
                indexed.FilterField('date_of_birth'),
            ]),
        ]

    # Search books where their author was born after 1950
    # Both the book title and the authors name will be searched
    >>> Book.objects.filter(author__date_of_birth__gt=date(1950, 1, 1)).search("Hello")

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_index_relatedfields`


Cross-linked admin search UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search interface in the Wagtail admin now includes a toolbar to quickly switch between different search types - pages, images, documents and users. A new :ref:`register_admin_search_area <register_admin_search_area>` hook is provided for adding new search types to this toolbar.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Added ``WagtailPageTests``, a helper module to simplify writing tests for Wagtail sites. See :doc:`/advanced_topics/testing`
 * Added system checks to check the ``subpage_types`` and ``parent_page_types`` attributes of page models

 * Submit for moderation notification emails now include the editor name (Denis Voskvitsov)
 * Updated fonts for more comprehensive Unicode support

 * ``wagtailadmin.utils.send_mail`` now passes extra keyword arguments to Django's ``send_mail`` function (Matthew Downey)
 * ``page_unpublish`` signal is now fired for each page that was unpublished by a call to ``PageQuerySet.unpublish()``
 * Add ``get_upload_to`` method to ``AbstractImage``, to allow overriding the default image upload path (Ben Emery)
 * Notification emails are now sent per user (Matthew Downey)
 * Added the ability to override the default manager on Page models
 * Added an optional human-friendly ``site_name`` field to sites (Timo Rieber)
 * Added a system check to warn developers who use a custom Wagtail build but forgot to build the admin css
 * Added success message after updating image from the image upload view (Christian Peters)

 * Filtering by popular tag in the image chooser now works when using the database search backend


Upgrade considerations
======================

Jinja2 template tag modules have changed location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to a change in the way template tags are imported in Django 1.9, it has been necessary to move the Jinja2 template tag modules from "templatetags" to a new location, "jinja2tags". The correct configuration settings to enable Jinja2 templates are now as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        # ...
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'extensions': [
                    'wagtail.wagtailcore.jinja2tags.core',
                    'wagtail.wagtailadmin.jinja2tags.userbar',
                    'wagtail.wagtailimages.jinja2tags.images',
                ],
            },
        }
    ]


See: :doc:`/advanced_topics/jinja2`


ContentType-returning methods in wagtailcore are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following internal functions and methods in ``wagtail.wagtailcore.models``, which return a list of ``ContentType`` objects, have been deprecated. Any uses of these in your code should be replaced by the corresponding new function which returns a list of model classes instead:

 * ``get_page_types()`` - replaced by ``get_page_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_subpage_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_subpage_models()``

In addition, note that these methods now return page types that are marked as ``is_creatable = False``, including the base ``Page`` class. (Abstract models are not included, as before.)
