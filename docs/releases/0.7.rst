What's new
==========

New interface for choosing images focal point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``content_type`` template filter has been removed from the project template, as the same thing can be accomplished with ``self.get_verbose_name|slugify``.
 * Page copy operations now also copy the page revision history.
 * Page models now support a ``parent_page_types`` property in addition to ``subpage types``, to restrict the types of page they can be created under.
 * ``register_snippet`` can now be invoked as a decorator.
