## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Removal of `imghdr` and upgrade to `Willow`

[`imghdr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imghdr.html) is deprecated, and will be removed in Python 3.13.

Wagtail now uses the Willow feature of providing the image MIME type, which uses the [`filetype`](https://pypi.org/project/filetype/) package.

### Adoption of `classname` convention for `MenuItem` related classes and hooks

Wagtail `MenuItem` and menu hooks have been updated to use the more consistent naming of `classname` (singular) instead of `classnames` (plural), a convention that started in Wagtail 4.2.

The current `classnames` keyword argument naming will be supported, but will trigger a deprecation warning. Support for this variant will be removed in a future release.

The following classes will adopt this new convention.

-   `admin.menu.MenuItem`
-   `admin.ui.sidebar.ActionMenuItem`
-   `admin.ui.sidebar.LinkMenuItem`
-   `admin.ui.sidebar.PageExplorerMenuItem`
-   `contrib.settings.registry.SettingMenuItem`

The following hooks usage may be impacted if `classnames` were used when generating menu items.

-   `register_admin_menu_item`
-   `register_settings_menu_item`

### Example

```python
from django.urls import reverse

from wagtail import hooks
from wagtail.admin.menu import MenuItem

@hooks.register('register_admin_menu_item')
def register_frank_menu_item():
  return MenuItem(
    'Frank',
    reverse('frank'),
    icon_name='folder-inverse',
    order=10000,
    classname="highlight-menu" # not classnames=...
  )
```

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### Legacy moderation system is deprecated

The legacy moderation system, which was replaced by the new workflow system in Wagtail 2.10, is now deprecated. Since Wagtail 2.10, submitting a page for moderation will use the new workflow system. However, the legacy moderation system is still in place for approving and rejecting pages that were submitted for moderation before Wagtail 2.10.

To view all pages that are still in the legacy moderation system backlog, you can sign in as a superuser and see if there is a "Pages awaiting moderation" section in the admin dashboard. You can approve or reject the pages from there. You can also do this programmatically by querying for `Revision.objects.filter(submitted_for_moderation=True)` and calling `revision.approve_moderation()` or `revision.reject_moderation()` on each revision.

The legacy moderation system will be removed in a future release. If you still have pages in the moderation queue that were submitted for moderation before Wagtail 2.10, you should approve or reject them before upgrading. See [](./2.10) for more details.

As a result, the following features are now deprecated:

- {attr}`wagtail.models.Revision.submitted_for_moderation`
- {attr}`wagtail.models.Revision.submitted_revisions`
- {meth}`wagtail.models.Revision.approve_moderation`
- {meth}`wagtail.models.Revision.reject_moderation`
- The `submitted_for_moderation` argument in {meth}`wagtail.models.RevisionMixin.save_revision`
- [`WAGTAIL_MODERATION_ENABLED`](wagtail_moderation_enabled)
- `wagtail.admin.userbar.ModeratePageItem`
- `wagtail.admin.userbar.ApproveModerationEditPageItem`
- `wagtail.admin.userbar.RejectModerationEditPageItem`
- `wagtail.admin.views.home.PagesForModerationPanel`
- `wagtail.admin.views.pages.moderation`
- `wagtail.permission_policies.pages.PagePermissionPolicy.revisions_for_moderation`

If you use any of the above features, remove them or replace them with the equivalent features from the new workflow system. The above features will be removed in a future release.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### Edit and delete URLs in `ModelViewSet` changed to allow non-integer primary keys

To accommodate models with non-integer primary keys, the URL patterns for the edit and delete views in {class}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet` have been changed.

Relative to the viewset's {attr}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_prefix`, the following changes have been made:
- The edit URL pattern has been changed from `<int:pk>/` to `edit/<str:pk>/`
- The delete URL pattern has been changed from `<int:pk>/delete/` to `delete/<str:pk>/`

If you use {func}`~django.urls.reverse` with {meth}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.get_url_name` to generate the URLs for these views, no changes are needed. However, if you have hard-coded these URLs in your code, you will need to update them to match the new patterns.

Redirects for the legacy URLs are in place for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in a future release.

The URLs for snippets underwent similar changes in Wagtail 2.14. The redirects for the legacy URLs in {class}`~wagtail.snippets.views.snippets.SnippetViewSet` have now been marked for removal in a future release.

### `ModelViewSet` automatically registers the model to the reference index

Models that are registered with a `ModelViewSet` now have reference index tracking enabled by default. This means that you no longer need to call `ReferenceIndex.register_model()` in your app's `ready()` method for such models. If this is undesired, you can disable it by setting {attr}`~wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.add_to_reference_index` to `False` on the `ModelViewSet` subclass. For more details, see [](managing_the_reference_index).

### Groups `IndexView.results_template_name` renamed from `results.html` to `index_results.html`

The `IndexView`'s `results_template_name` attribute in the `GroupViewSet` has been renamed from `wagtailusers/groups/results.html` to `wagtailusers/groups/index_results.html` for consistency with the other viewsets. If you have customised or extended the template, e.g. for [](customising_group_views), you will need to rename it to match the new name.

### Breadcrumbs class name has changed

If using custom styling for the breadcrumbs, this class has changed from singular to plural for a more intuitive class.

| Old              | New               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `'w-breadcrumb'` | `'w-breadcrumbs'` |

### Breadcrumbs now use different data attributes and events

The undocumented JavaScript implementation for the header breadcrumbs component has been migrated to a Stimulus controller and now uses different data attributes.

This may impact custom header implementations that relied on the previous approach, custom breadcrumbs that did not use `breadcrumbs` and require the expand/collapse behaviour may be impacted.

#### Events

| Old                              | New                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `'wagtail:breadcrumbs-expand'`   | `'w-breadcrumbs:opened'` |
| `'wagtail:breadcrumbs-collapse'` | `'w-breadcrumbs:closed'` |

#### Data attributes

| Old                       | New                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `data-breadcrumb-next`    | `data-controller="w-breadcrumbs"`                                                                      |
| `data-toggle-breadcrumbs` | `data-w-breadcrumbs-target="toggle" data-action="w-breadcrumbs#toggle mouseenter->w-breadcrumbs#peek"` |
| `data-breadcrumb-item`    | `data-w-breadcrumbs-target="content"`                                                                  |

Note that the root DOM element also includes a set of additional data attributes to function as the breadcrumbs:

```
data-controller="w-breadcrumbs"
data-action="keyup.esc@document->w-breadcrumbs#close w-breadcrumbs:open@document->w-breadcrumbs#open w-breadcrumbs:close@document->w-breadcrumbs#close"
data-w-breadcrumbs-close-icon-class="icon-cross"
data-w-breadcrumbs-closed-value="true"
data-w-breadcrumbs-open-icon-class="icon-breadcrumb-expand"
data-w-breadcrumbs-opened-content-class="w-max-w-4xl"
data-w-breadcrumbs-peek-target-value="header"
```

### `window.updateFooterSaveWarning` global util removed

The undocumented global util `window.updateFooterSaveWarning` has been removed, this is part of the footer 'unsaved' messages toggling behaviour on page forms.
This behaviour has now moved to a Stimulus controller and leverages DOM events instead. Calling this function will do nothing and in a future release will throw an error.

You can implement roughly the equivalent functionality with this JavaScript function, however, this will not be guaranteed to work in future releases.

```js
window.updateFooterSaveWarning = (formDirty, commentsDirty) => {
  if (!formDirty && !commentsDirty) {
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('w-unsaved:clear'));
  } else {
    const [type] = [
      formDirty && commentsDirty && 'all',
      commentsDirty && 'comments',
      formDirty && 'edits',
    ].filter(Boolean);
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('w-unsaved:add', { detail: { type } }));
  }
};
```

### Snippets templates refactored to reuse the shared `slim_header.html` template

The templates for the snippets views have been refactored to reuse the shared `slim_header.html` template. If you have customised or extended the templates, e.g. for [](wagtailsnippets_custom_admin_views), you will need to update them to match the new structure. As a result, the following templates have been removed:

- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/_base_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/create_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/edit_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/history_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/list_header.html`
- `wagtailsnippets/snippets/headers/usage_header.html`

In most cases, the usage of those templates can be replaced with the `wagtailadmin/shared/headers/slim_header.html` template. Refer to the snippets views and templates code for more details.

### `dropdown` template tag argument `toggle_tippy_offset` renamed to `toggle_tooltip_offset`

The naming conventions for `tippy` related attributes have been updated to align with the generic `tooltip` naming.

If you are using the undocumented dropdown template tag with the offset arg, this will need to be updated.

| Old                                                                | New                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{% dropdown toggle_tippy_offset="[0, -2]" %}...{% enddropdown %}` | `{% dropdown toggle_tooltip_offset="[0, -2]" %}...{% enddropdown %}` |

### `escapescript` template tag and `escape_script` functions are deprecated

As of this release, the undocumented `coreutils.escape_script` util and `escapescript` template tag will no longer be supported.

This was used to provide a way for HTML template content in IE11, which is no longer supported, and was non-compliant with CSP support.

The current approach will trigger a deprecation warning and will be removed in a future release.

#### Old

```html+django
{% load wagtailadmin_tags %}
<script type="text/django-form-template" id="id_{{ formset.prefix }}-EMPTY_FORM_TEMPLATE">
    {% escapescript %}
        <div>Widget template content</div>
        <script src="/js/my-widget.js"></script>
    {% endescapescript %}
</script>
```

#### New

Use the HTML [`template`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) element to avoid content from being parsed by the browser on load.

```html+django
<template id="id_{{ formset.prefix }}-EMPTY_FORM_TEMPLATE">
    <div>Widget template content</div>
    <script src="/js/my-widget.js"></script>
</template>
```

### `BaseSidePanels`, `PageSidePanels` and `SnippetSidePanels` classes are removed

The `BaseSidePanels`, `PageSidePanels` and `SnippetSidePanels` classes that were used to combine the side panels (i.e. status, preview and comments side panels) have been removed. Each side panel is now instantiated directly in the view. The `wagtail.admin.ui.components.MediaContainer` class can be used to combine the [`Media`](django:topics/forms/media) objects for the side panels.

The `BasePreviewSidePanel`, `PagePreviewSidePanel` and `SnippetPreviewSidePanel` classes have been replaced with the consolidated `PreviewSidePanel` class.

The `BaseStatusSidePanel` class has been renamed to `StatusSidePanel`.

If you use these classes in your code, you will need to update your code to instantiate the side panels directly in the view.

For example, if you have the following code:

```python
from wagtail.admin.ui.side_panels import PageSidePanels


def my_view(request):
    ...

    side_panels = PageSidePanels(
        request,
        page.get_latest_revision_as_object(),
        show_schedule_publishing_toggle=False,
        live_page=page,
        scheduled_page=page.get_scheduled_revision_as_object(),
        in_explorer=False,
        preview_enabled=True,
        comments_enabled=False,
    )

    return render(
        request,
        template_name,
        {"page": page, "side_panels": side_panels, "media": side_panels.media},
    )
```

Update it to the following:

```python
from wagtail.admin.ui.components import MediaContainer
from wagtail.admin.ui.side_panels import PageStatusSidePanel, PreviewSidePanel


def my_view(request):
    ...

    side_panels = [
        PageStatusSidePanel(
            page,
            request,
            show_schedule_publishing_toggle=False,
            live_object=page,
            scheduled_object=page.get_scheduled_revision_as_object(),
            locale=page.locale,
            translations=translations,
        ),
        PreviewSidePanel(
            page,
            request,
            preview_url=reverse("wagtailadmin_pages:preview_on_edit", args=[page.id]),
        ),
    ]
    side_panels = MediaContainer(side_panels)

    return render(
        request,
        template_name,
        {"page": page, "side_panels": side_panels, "media": side_panels.media},
    )
```

### `construct_snippet_listing_buttons` hook no longer accepts a `context` argument

The [`construct_snippet_listing_buttons`](construct_snippet_listing_buttons) hook no longer accepts a `context` argument. If you have implemented this hook, you will need to remove the `context` argument from your implementation. If you need to access values computed by the view, you'll need to override the {attr}`~wagtail.snippets.views.snippets.SnippetViewSet.index_view_class` with a custom `IndexView` subclass. The `get_list_buttons` and `get_list_more_buttons` methods in particular may be overridden to customise the buttons on the listing.

Defining a function for this hook that accepts the `context` argument will raise a warning, and the function will receive an empty dictionary (`{}`) as the `context`. Support for defining the `context` argument will be completely removed in a future Wagtail release.

### Adoption of `classname` convention within the Image `Format` instance

When using `wagtail.images.formats.Format`, the created instance set the argument for classes to the attribute `classnames` (plural), this has now changed to `classname` (singular).

For any custom code that accessed or modified this undocumented attribute, updates will need to be made as follows.

Accessing `self.classnames` will still work until a future release, simply returning `self.classname`, but this will raise a deprecation warning.

```python
# image_formats.py
from django.utils.html import format_html
from wagtail.images.formats import Format, register_image_format


class CustomImageFormat(Format):

    def image_to_html(self, image, alt_text, extra_attributes=None):
        # contrived example - pull out the class and render on outside element
        classname = self.classname # not self.classnames
        self.classname = "" # not self.classnames
        inner_html = super().image_to_html(image, alt_text, extra_attributes)
        return format_html("<custom-image class='{}'>{}</custom-image>", classname, inner_html)


custom_format = CustomImageFormat('custom_example', 'Custom example', 'example-image object-fit', 'width-750')

register_image_format(custom_format)
```
