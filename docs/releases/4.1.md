Wagtail 4.1 is designated a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Long Term Support releases will continue to receive maintenance updates as necessary to address security and data-loss related issues, up until the next LTS release (typically a period of 12 months).

 * Provide a more accessible page title where the unique information is shown first and the CMS name is shown last (Mehrdad Moradizadeh)

 * Show an inverse locked indicator when the page has been locked by the current user in reports and dashboard listings (Vaibhav Shukla, LB (Ben Johnston))

 * Unify the styling of delete/destructive button styles across the admin interface (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Adopt new designs and unify the styling styles for `.button-secondary` buttons across the admin interface (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Refine designs for disabled buttons throughout the admin interface (Paarth Agarwal)

 * Revise colour usage so that privacy & locked indicators can be seen in Windows High Contrast mode (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Ensure that disabled buttons have a consistent presentation on hover to indicate no interaction is available (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Update the 'Locked pages' report menu title so that it is consistent with other pages reports and its own title on viewing (Nicholas Johnson)
 * Support `formfield_callback` handling on `ModelForm.Meta` for future Django 4.2 release (Matt Westcott)
 * Ensure that `ModelAdmin` correctly supports filters in combination with subsequent searches without clearing the applied filters (Stefan Hammer)

## Upgrade considerations

### Button styling class changes

The `button-secondary` class is no longer compatible with either the `.serious` or `.no` classes, this partially worked previously but is no longer officially supported.

When adding custom buttons using the `ModelAdmin` `ButtonHelper` class, custom buttons will no longer include the `button-secondary` class by default in index listings.

If using the hook `register_user_listing_buttons` to register buttons along with the undocumented `UserListingButton` class, the `button-secondary` class will no longer be included by default.

Avoid using `disabled` as a class on `button` elements, instead use the [`disabled` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) as support for this as a class may be removed in a future version of Wagtail and is not accessible.

If using custom `expanding-formset` the add button will no longer support the `disabled` class but instead must require the `disabled` attribute to be set.

The following button classes have been removed, none of which were being used within the admin but may have been used by custom code or packages:

* `button-neutral`
* `button-strokeonhover`
* `hover-no`
* `unbutton`
* `yes`
