## What's new

### Page editor redesign

Here are other changes related to the redesign:

 * Switch the Wagtail branding font to a system font stack (Steven Steinwand)
 * Remove most uppercased text styles from admin UI (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Convert all UI code to CSS logical properties for Right-to-Left (RTL) language support (Thibaud Colas)


### Removal of special-purpose field panel types

The panel types `StreamFieldPanel`, `RichTextFieldPanel`, `ImageChooserPanel`, `DocumentChooserPanel` and `SnippetChooserPanel` have been phased out, and can now be replaced with `FieldPanel`. Additionally, `PageChooserPanel` is only required when passing a `page_type` or `can_choose_root`, and can otherwise be replaced with `FieldPanel`. In all cases, `FieldPanel` will now automatically select the most appropriate form element. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott.


### Permission-dependent FieldPanels

[`FieldPanel`](wagtail.admin.edit_handlers.FieldPanel) now accepts a `permission` keyword argument to specify that the field should only be available to users with a given permission level. This feature was developed by Matt Westcott and sponsored by Google as part of Wagtail's page editor redevelopment.


### Other features

 * Upgrade ESLint and Stylelint configurations to latest shared Wagtail configs (Thibaud Colas, Paarth Agarwal)
 * Major updates to frontend tooling; move Node tooling from Gulp to Webpack, upgrade to Node v16 and npm v8, eslint v8, stylelint v14 and others (Thibaud Colas)
 * Change comment headers’ date formatting to use browser APIs instead of requiring a library (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Lint with flake8-comprehensions and flake8-assertive, including adding a pre-commit hook for these (Mads Jensen, Dan Braghis)
 * Add black configuration and reformat code using it (Dan Braghis)
 * Remove UI code for legacy browser support: polyfills, IE11 workarounds, Modernizr (Thibaud Colas)
 * Remove redirect auto-creation recipe from documentation as this feature is now supported in Wagtail core (Andy Babic)
 * Remove IE11 warnings (Gianluca De Cola)
 * Replace `content_json` `TextField` with `content` `JSONField` in `PageRevision` (Sage Abdullah)

 * Adopt [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for parsing documentation written in Markdown, replaces recommonmark (LB (Ben Johnston), Thibaud Colas)
 * Installing docs extras requirements in CircleCI so issues with the docs requirements are picked up earlier (Thibaud Colas)
 * Remove core usage of jinjalint and migrate to curlylint to resolve dependency incompatibility issues (Thibaud Colas)
 * Switch focus outlines implementation to `:focus-visible` for cross-browser consistency (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Migrate multiple documentation pages from RST to MD (Vibhakar Solanki, LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Add documentation for defining [custom form validation](modeladmin_custom_clean) on models used in Wagtail's `modelAdmin` (Serafeim Papastefanos)
 * Update `README.md` logo to work for GitHub dark mode (Paarth Agarwal)
 * Avoid an unnecessary page reload when pressing enter within the header search bar (Images, Pages, Documents) (Riley de Mestre)
 * Removed unofficial length parameter on `If-Modified-Since` header in `sendfile_streaming_backend` which was only used by IE (Mariusz Felisiak)


### Bug fixes

 * Update django-treebeard dependency to 4.5.1 or above (Serafeim Papastefanos)
 * When using `simple_translations` ensure that the user is redirected to the page edit view when submitting for a single locale (Mitchel Cabuloy)
 * When previewing unsaved changes to `Form` pages, ensure that all added fields are correctly shown in the preview (Joshua Munn)
 * When Documents (e.g. PDFs) have been configured to be served inline via `WAGTAILDOCS_CONTENT_TYPES` & `WAGTAILDOCS_INLINE_CONTENT_TYPES` ensure that the filename is correctly set in the `Content-Disposition` header so that saving the files will use the correct filename (John-Scott Atlakson)
 * Improve the contrast of the “Remember me” checkbox against the login page’s background (Steven Steinwand)
 * Group permission rows with custom permissions no longer have extra padding (Steven Steinwand)
 * Make sure the focus outline of checkboxes is fully around the outer border (Steven Steinwand)
 * Consistently set `aria-haspopup="menu"` for all sidebar menu items that have sub-menus (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Make sure `aria-expanded` is always explicitly set as a string in sidebar (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Use a button element instead of a link for page explorer menu item, for the correct semantics and behavior (LB (Ben Johnston))


## Upgrade considerations

### Removed warning in Internet Explorer (IE11)

* IE11 support was officially dropped in Wagtail 2.15, as of this release there will no longer be a warning shown to users of this browser.
* Wagtail is fully compatible with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft’s replacement for Internet Explorer. You may consider using its `IE mode <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-ie-mode>`_ to keep access to IE11-only sites, while other sites and apps like Wagtail can leverage modern browser capabilities.

### Replaced `content_json` `TextField` with `content` `JSONField` in `PageRevision`

* The `content_json` field in the `PageRevision` model has been renamed to `content`.
* The field now internally uses `JSONField` instead of `TextField`.
* If you have a large number of `PageRevision` objects, running the migrations might take a while.

### Replaced `data_json` `TextField` with `data` `JSONField` in `BaseLogEntry`

* The `data_json` field in the `BaseLogEntry` model has been renamed to `data`.
* The field now internally uses `JSONField` instead of `TextField`.
* The default empty value for the field has been changed from `""` to `{}`.
* This change also affects `BaseLogEntry` subclasses, i.e. `PageLogEntry` and `ModelLogEntry`.
* If you have a large number of objects for these models, running the migrations might take a while.

### Hallo legacy rich text editor has moved to an external package

* Hallo was deprecated in [Wagtail v2.0 (February 2018)](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.0.html#new-rich-text-editor) and has had only a minimal level of support since then.
* If you still require Hallo for your Wagtail installation, you will need to install the [Wagtail Hallo editor](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-hallo) legacy package.
* We encourage all users of the Hallo editor to take steps to migrate to the new Draftail editor as this external package is unlikely to have ongoing maintenance.
* `window.registerHalloPlugin` will no longer be created on the page editor load, unless the legacy package is installed.

### Phasing-out of special-purpose field panel types

As of this release, the use of special-purpose field panel types such as `StreamFieldPanel` and `ImageChooserPanel` is being phased out, and developers will generally expect to be able to use a plain `FieldPanel` instead. For this reason, developers of third-party packages implementing their own field panel types are recommended to follow suit and ensure that their code also works with `FieldPanel`. The steps for doing this will depend on the package's functionality, but in general:

 * If the panel sets a custom template, your code should instead define [a `Widget` class](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/) that produces your desired HTML rendering.
 * If the panel provides a `widget_overrides` method, your code should instead call [`register_form_field_override`](/extending/forms) so that the desired widget is always selected for the relevant model field type.
 * If the panel provides a `get_comparison_class` method, your code should instead call `wagtail.admin.compare.register_comparison_class` to register the comparison class against the relevant model field type.

If you do continue to use a custom panel class, note that the template context for panels derived from `BaseChooserPanel` has changed - the context variable `is_chosen`, and the variable name given by the panel's `object_type_name` property, are no longer available on the template. The only available variables are now `field` and `show_add_comment_button`. If your template depends on these additional variables, you will need to pass them explicitly by overriding the `render_as_field` method.

### ModelAdmin forms must subclass `WagtailAdminModelForm`

When overriding the `get_form_class` method of a ModelAdmin `CreateView` or `EditView` to pass a custom form class, that form class must now inherit from `wagtail.admin.forms.models.WagtailAdminModelForm`. Passing a plain Django ModelForm subclass is no longer valid.

### Removed the `size` argument of the undocumented `wagtail.utils.sendfile_streaming_backend.was_modified_since` function

-   The `size` argument was used to add a `length` parameter to the HTTP header.
-   This was never part of the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 specifications see [RFC7232](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7232.html#header.if-modified-since) and existed only as a an unofficial implementation in IE browsers.
