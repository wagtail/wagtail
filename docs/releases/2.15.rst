Upgrade considerations
======================

Admin homepage panels, summary items and action menu items now use components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _template_components_2_15:

Several Wagtail hooks provide a mechanism for passing Python objects to be rendered as HTML inside admin views, and the APIs for these objects have been updated to adopt a common :doc:`template components </extending/template_components>` pattern. The affected objects are:

 * Homepage panels (as registered with the :ref:`construct_homepage_panels` hook)
 * Homepage summary items (as registered with the :ref:`construct_homepage_summary_items` hook)
 * Page action menu items (as registered with the :ref:`register_page_action_menu_item` and :ref:`construct_page_action_menu` hooks)
 * Snippet action menu items (as registered with the :ref:`register_snippet_action_menu_item` and :ref:`construct_snippet_action_menu` hooks)

User code that creates these objects should be updated to follow the component API. This will typically require the following changes:

 * Homepage panels should be made subclasses of ``wagtail.admin.ui.components.Component``, and the ``render(self)`` method should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``. (Alternatively, rather than defining ``render_html``, it may be more convenient to reimplement it with a template, as per :ref:`creating_template_components`.)
 * Summary item classes can continue to inherit from ``wagtail.admin.site_summary.SummaryItem`` (which is now a subclass of ``Component``) as before, but:

   * Any ``template`` attribute should be changed to ``template_name``;
   * Any place where the ``render(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``;
   * Any place where the ``get_context(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``get_context_data(self, parent_context)``.

 * Action menu items for pages and snippets can continue to inherit from ``wagtail.admin.action_menu.ActionMenuItem`` and ``wagtail.snippets.action_menu.ActionMenuItem`` respectively - these are now subclasses of ``Component`` - but:

   * Any ``template`` attribute should be changed to ``template_name``;
   * Any ``get_context`` method should be renamed to ``get_context_data``;
   * The ``get_url``, ``is_shown``, ``get_context_data`` and ``render_html`` methods no longer accept a ``request`` parameter. The request object is available in the context dictionary as ``context['request']``.


Passing callables as messages in ``register_log_actions`` is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When defining new action types for :ref:`audit logging <audit_log>` with the :ref:`register_log_actions` hook, it was previously possible to pass a callable as the message. This is now deprecated - to define a message that depends on the log entry's data, you should now create a subclass of ``wagtail.core.log_actions.LogFormatter``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from wagtail.core import hooks

    @hooks.register('register_log_actions')
    def additional_log_actions(actions):

        def greeting_message(data):
            return _('Hello %(audience)s') % {
                'audience': data['audience'],
            }
        actions.register_action('wagtail_package.greet_audience', _('Greet audience'), greeting_message)

should now be rewritten as:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from wagtail.core import hooks
    from wagtail.core.log_actions import LogFormatter

    @hooks.register('register_log_actions')
    def additional_log_actions(actions):

        @actions.register_action('wagtail_package.greet_audience')
        class GreetingActionFormatter(LogFormatter):
            label = _('Greet audience')

            def format_message(self, log_entry):
                return _('Hello %(audience)s') % {
                    'audience': log_entry.data['audience'],
                }
