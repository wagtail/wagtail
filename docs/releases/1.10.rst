What's new
==========

PostgreSQL search engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new search engine has been added to Wagtail which uses PostgreSQL's built-in
full-text search functionality. This means that if you use PostgreSQL to manage
your database, you can now get a good quality search engine without needing
to install Elasticsearch.

This feature was developed at the Arnhem sprint by Bertrand Bordage, Jaap Roes,
Arne de Laat and Ramon de Jezus.


Django 1.11 and Python 3.6 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail is now compatible with Django 1.11 and Python 3.6. Compatibility fixes were contributed by Tim Graham, Matt Westcott, Mikalai Radchuk and Bertrand Bordage.


User language preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now set their preferred language for the Wagtail admin interface under Account Settings → Language Preferences. The list of available languages can be configured via the :ref:`WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES <WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES>` setting. This feature was developed by Daniel Chimeno.


New admin preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previewing pages in Wagtail admin interface was rewritten
to make it more robust. In previous versions, preview was broken in several
scenarios so users often ended up on a blank page with an infinite spinner.

An additional setting was created: :ref:`WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW <WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW>`.
It allows users to see changes done in the editor by refreshing the preview tab
without having to click again on the preview button.

This was developed by Bertrand Bordage.

Upgrade considerations
======================

Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 support dropped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Django 1.9 and Python 3.3 has been dropped in this release; please upgrade from these before upgrading Wagtail. Note that the Django 1.8 release series is still supported, as a Long Term Support release.


Dropped support for generating static sites using ``django-medusa``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django-medusa is no longer maintained, and is incompatible with Django 1.8 and above. An alternative module based on the `django-bakery` package is available as a third-party contribution: https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-bakery.


Signals on custom ``Image`` and ``Rendition`` models connected automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects using :ref:`custom image models <custom_image_model>` no longer need to set up signal receivers to handle deletion of image files and image feature detection, as these are now handled automatically by Wagtail. The following lines of code should be removed:

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete the source image file when an image is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Delete the rendition image file when a rendition is deleted
    @receiver(post_delete, sender=CustomRendition)
    def rendition_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.file.delete(False)


    # Perform image feature detection (if enabled)
    @receiver(pre_save, sender=CustomImage)
    def image_feature_detection(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        if not instance.has_focal_point():
            instance.set_focal_point(instance.get_suggested_focal_point())


Adding / editing users through Wagtail admin no longer sets ``is_staff`` flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the ``is_staff`` flag (which grants access to the Django admin interface) was automatically set for superusers, and reset for other users, when creating and updating users through the Wagtail admin. This behaviour has now been removed, since Wagtail is designed to work independently of the Django admin. If you need to reinstate the old behaviour, you can set up a `pre_save signal handler <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/signals/#django.db.models.signals.pre_save>`_ on the User model to set the flag appropriately.


Specifying the full file name in documents URL is mandatory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous releases, it was possible to download a document using
the primary key and a fraction of its file name, or even without file name.
You could get the same document at the addresses
``/documents/1/your-file-name.pdf``, ``/documents/1/you`` & ``/documents/1/``.

This feature was supposed to allow shorter URLs but was not used in Wagtail.
For security reasons, we removed it, so only the full URL works:
``/documents/1/your-file-name.pdf``

If any of your applications relied on the previous behaviour, you will have to
rewrite it to take this into account.
