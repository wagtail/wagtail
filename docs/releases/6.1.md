## Upgrade considerations

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customizations

### Changes to `SubmissionsListView` class

As part of the Universal Listings project, the `SubmissionsListView` for listing form submissions in the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app has been refactored to become a subclass of `wagtail.admin.views.generic.base.BaseListingView`. As a result, the class has undergone a number of changes, including the following:

- The filtering mechanism has been reimplemented to use django-filter.
- The `ordering` attribute has been renamed to `default_ordering`.
- The template used to render the view has been significantly refactored to use the new universal listings UI.


### `register_user_listing_buttons` hook signature changed

The function signature for the [`register_user_listing_buttons`](register_user_listing_buttons) hook was updated to accept a `request_user` argument instead of `context`. If you use this hook, make sure to update your function signature to match the new one. The old signature with `context` will continue to work for now, but the context only contains the request object. Support for the old signature will be removed in a future release.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Deprecation of `user_listing_buttons` template tag

The undocumented `user_listing_buttons` template tag has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### Deprecation of `wagtailusers_groups:users` URL pattern

The undocumented `wagtailusers_groups:users` URL pattern has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are using `reverse` with this URL pattern name, you should update your code to use the `wagtailusers_users:index` URL pattern name and the group ID as the `group` query parameter. For example:

```python
reverse('wagtailusers_groups:users', args=[group.id])
```

should be updated to:

```python
reverse('wagtailusers_users:index') + f'?group={group.id}'
```

The corresponding `wagtailusers_groups:users_results` URL pattern has been removed as part of this change.

A redirect from the old URL pattern to the new one has been added to ensure that existing URLs continue to work. This redirect will be removed in a future release.

### Deprecation of `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers

The undocumented usage of the JavaScript `window.chooserUrls` within Draftail choosers will be removed in a future release.

The following `chooserUrl` object values will be impacted.

-   `anchorLinkChooser`
-   `documentChooser`
-   `emailLinkChooser`
-   `embedsChooser`
-   `externalLinkChooser`
-   `imageChooser`
-   `pageChooser`

Overriding these inner values on the global `window.chooserUrls` object will still override their usage in the Draftail choosers for now but this capability will be removed in a future release.

#### Example

It's recommended that usage of this global is removed in any customizations or third party packages and instead a custom Draftail Entity be used instead. See example below.

##### Old

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

@hooks.register("insert_editor_js")
def editor_js():
    return format_html(
        """
        <script>
            window.chooserUrls.myCustomChooser = '{0}';
        </script>
        """,
        reverse("myapp_chooser:choose"),
    )
```

##### New

Remove the `insert_editor_js` hook usage and instead pass the data needed via the Entity's data.

```python
# .../wagtail_hooks.py

from django.urls import reverse_lazy

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def register_my_custom_feature(features):
    # features.register_link_type...

    features.register_editor_plugin(
        "draftail",
        "custom-link",
        draftail_features.EntityFeature(
            {
                "type": "CUSTOM_ITEM",
                "icon": "doc-full-inverse",
                "description": gettext_lazy("Item"),
                "chooserUrls": {
                    # Important: `reverse_lazy` must be used unless the URL path is hard-coded
                    "myChooser": reverse_lazy("myapp_chooser:choose")
                },
            },
            js=["..."],
        ),
    )

```

#### Overriding existing `chooserUrls` values

To override existing chooser Entities' `chooserUrls` values, here is an example of an unsupported monkey patch can achieve a similar goal.

However, it's recommended that a [custom Entity be created](creating_new_draftail_editor_entities) to be registered as a replacement feature for Draftail customizations as per the documentation.

```py
# .../wagtail_hooks.py
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

from wagtail import hooks

@hooks.register("register_rich_text_features")
def override_embed_feature_url(features):
    features.plugins_by_editor["draftail"]["embed"].data["chooserUrls"]["embedsChooser"] = reverse_lazy("my_embeds:chooser")
```

### Deprecation of `window.initBlockWidget` to initialize a StreamField block

The undocumented global function `window.initBlockWidget` has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Any complex customizations that have re-implemented parts of this functionality will need to be modified to adopt the new approach that uses Stimulus and avoids inline scripts.

The usage of this new approach is still unofficial and could change in the future, it's recommended that the documented `BlockWidget` and `StreamField` approaches be used instead.

However, for comparison, here is the old and new approach below.

### Old

Assuming we are using Django's `format_html` to prepare the HTML output with `JSON.dumps` strings for the block data values.

The old approach would call the `window.initBlockWidget` global function with an inline script as follows:

```html
<div
    id="{id}"
    data-block="{block_json}"
    data-value="{value_json}"
    data-error="{error_json}"
></div>
<script>
    initBlockWidget('{id}');
</script>
```

### New

In the new approach, we no longer need to attach an inline script but instead use the Stimulus data attributes to attach the behavior with the `w-block` identifier as follows:

```html
<div
    id="{id}"
    data-block
    data-controller="w-block"
    data-w-block-data-value="{block_json}"
    data-w-block-arguments-value="[{value_json},{error_json}]"
></div>
```
