Upgrade considerations
======================

Removed support for Python 3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.4 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.5 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

Icon font implementation changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The icon font implementation has been changed to be invisible, by switching to using `Private Use Areas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas>`_ Unicode code points. All of the icon classes (``icon-user``, ``icon-search``, etc) should still work the same, except for two which have been removed because they were duplicates:

 * ``icon-picture`` is removed. Use ``icon-image`` instead (same visual).
 * ``icon-file-text-alt`` is removed. Use ``icon-doc-full`` instead (same visual).

For a list of all available icons, please see the :ref:`styleguide`.
