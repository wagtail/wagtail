Copying Pages
_____________

Sometimes you might not need to create a new page from scratch. For example, you could have several pages that are very similar in terms of structure, but differ in content. In that case, you can copy an existing page and only change the required parts.

Here is how to copy an existing page:

* When you hover over a page in an :doc:`Explorer page <finding_your_way_around/the_explorer_page>`, click on *More* and then *Copy*.

* You are then taken to a form where you can enter the copy's title, slug and choose the parent page (if you want to change it). You then get the option to publish the copied page right away and an option to mark the copy as an alias of the original page (see :ref:`aliasing-page-label` for more information about aliasing pages).

* Once you completed this form, press *Copy this page*. The page will then be copied and appear in the Explorer page.

Aliasing pages
______________

When copying a page, you also have the option to create an alias to it. Let's say you have a page about Brioche in the Breads section. At the same time, you might also want to have it in the Pastries section. You could create a copy and change both whenever there is a modification to be made. A more efficient way that ensures synchronisation between the two is aliasing the page during the copy process.

Here is how you can create an alias to an existing page:

* The first step is the same as it was for :ref:`copying-page-label`. When you hover over a page in an :doc:`Explorer page <finding_your_way_around/the_explorer_page>`, click on *More* and then *Copy*.
* When you get to the copy page form, you can then choose another page as the parent page. Click the *Choose another page* button.

* Select and click on the new page to act as the parent page.

* Make sure the Alias checkbox is ticked. You can then complete the page aliasing by clicking on the *Copy this page* button.

* The aliased page will then appear under the new parent page.

* If you try to edit the aliased page, you will get notified that it is an alias of another page and be offered two options: either to edit the original page (with changes appearing in both places) or convert the alias page into a regular page (i.e. a regular copy).
