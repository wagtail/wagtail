## Upgrade considerations

### Wagtail-specific image field (`WagtailImageField`)

The `AbstractImage` and `AbstractRendition` models use a Wagtail-specific `WagtailImageField` which extends Django's `ImageField`
to use [Willow](https://github.com/wagtail/Willow/) for image file handling. This will generate a new migration if you
are using a [custom image model](custom_image_model)

### Comments within `InlinePanel` not supported

When the commenting system was introduced, support for `InlinePanel` fields was incorrectly added. This has lead to issues
where comments can be lost on save or in most cases will be added to the incorrect item within the `InlinePanel`. The ability
to add comments here has now been removed and as such any existing comments that were added will no longer show.

See https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/9685 for tracking of adding this back officially in the future.
