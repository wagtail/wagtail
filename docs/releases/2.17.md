## What's new

### Page editor redesign

Here are other changes related to the redesign:

 * Switch the Wagtail branding font to a system font stack (Steven Steinwand)

### Other features

 * Upgrade ESLint and Stylelint configurations to latest shared Wagtail configs (Thibaud Colas)
 * Major updates to frontend tooling; move Node tooling from Gulp to Webpack, upgrade to Node v16 and npm v8, eslint v8, stylelint v14 and others (Thibaud Colas)
 * Change comment headers’ date formatting to use browser APIs instead of requiring a library (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Lint with flake8-comprehensions and flake8-assertive, including adding a pre-commit hook for these (Mads Jensen, Dan Braghis)
 * Add black configuration and reformat code using it (Dan Braghis)
 * Remove UI code for legacy browser support: polyfills, IE11 workarounds, Modernizr (Thibaud Colas)
 * Remove redirect auto-creation recipe from documentation as this feature is now supported in Wagtail core (Andy Babic)
 * Remove IE11 warnings (Gianluca De Cola)
 * Replace `content_json` `TextField` with `content` `JSONField` in `PageRevision` (Sage Abdullah)
 * Remove `replace_text` management command (Sage Abdullah)


### Bug fixes

 * Update django-treebeard dependency to 4.5.1 or above (Serafeim Papastefanos)
 * When using `simple_translations` ensure that the user is redirected to the page edit view when submitting for a single locale (Mitchel Cabuloy)
 * When previewing unsaved changes to `Form` pages, ensure that all added fields are correctly shown in the preview (Joshua Munn)
 * When Documents (e.g. PDFs) have been configured to be served inline via `WAGTAILDOCS_CONTENT_TYPES` & `WAGTAILDOCS_INLINE_CONTENT_TYPES` ensure that the filename is correctly set in the `Content-Disposition` header so that saving the files will use the correct filename (John-Scott Atlakson)


## Upgrade considerations

### Removed warning in Internet Explorer (IE11)

* IE11 support was officially dropped in Wagtail 2.15, as of this release there will no longer be a warning shown to users of this browser.
* Wagtail is fully compatible with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft’s replacement for Internet Explorer. You may consider using its `IE mode <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-ie-mode>`_ to keep access to IE11-only sites, while other sites and apps like Wagtail can leverage modern browser capabilities.

### Replaced `content_json` `TextField` with `content` `JSONField` in `PageRevision`

* The `content_json` field in the `PageRevision` model has been renamed to `content`.
* The field now internally uses `JSONField` instead of `TextField`.
* If you have a large number of `PageRevision` objects, running the migrations might take a while.
