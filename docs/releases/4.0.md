## What's new

### Image renditions can now be prefetched by filter

When using a queryset to render a list of images, you can now use the `prefetch_renditions()` queryset method to prefetch the renditions needed for rendering with a single extra query, similar to `prefetch_related`. If you have many renditions per image, you can also call it with filters as arguments - `prefetch_renditions("fill-700x586", "min-600x400")` - to fetch only the renditions you intend on using for a smaller query. For long lists of images, this can provide a significant boost to performance. See [](prefetching_image_renditions) for more examples. This feature was developed by Tidiane Dia and Karl Hobley.

### Rich text improvements

As part of the page editor redesign project sponsored by Google, we have made a number of improvements to our rich text editor:

* Inline toolbar: The toolbar now shows inline, to avoid clashing with the page’s header.
* Command palette: Start a block with a slash ‘/’ to open the palette and change the text format.
* Character count: The character count is displayed underneath the editor, live-updating as you type. This counts the length of the text, not of any formatting.
* Paste to auto-create links: To add a link from your copy-paste clipboard, select text and paste the URL.
* Text shortcuts undo: The editor normally converts text starting with `1. ` to a list item. It’s now possible to un-do this change and keep the text as-is. This works for all Markdown-style shortcuts.
* RTL support: The editor’s UI now displays correctly in right-to-left languages.
* Focus-aware placeholder: The editor’s placeholder text will now follow the user’s focus, to make it easier to understand where to type in long fields.
* Empty heading highlight: The editor now highlights empty headings and list items by showing their type (“Heading 3”) as a placeholder, so content is less likely to be published with empty headings.

### Live preview panel

Wagtail’s page preview is now available in a side panel within the page editor. This preview auto-updates as users type, and can display the page in three different viewports: mobile, tablet, desktop. The existing preview functionality is still present, moved inside the preview panel rather than at the bottom of the page editor. The auto-update delay can be configured with the `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL` setting. This feature was developed by Sage Abdullah.

## Upgrade considerations

### `base_url_path` keyword argument added to AdminURLHelper

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.helpers.AdminURLHelper` class now accepts a `base_url_path` keyword argument on its constructor. Custom subclasses of this class should be updated to accept this keyword argument.

### Dropped support for Safari 13

Safari 13 will no longer be officially supported as of this release, this deviates the current support for the last 3 version of Safari by a few months and was required to add better support for RTL languages.

### `PageRevision` replaced with `Revision`

The `PageRevision` model has been replaced with a generic `Revision` model. If you use the `PageRevision` model in your code, make sure that:

 * Creation of `PageRevision` objects should be updated to create `Revision` objects using the page's `id` as the `object_id`, the default `Page` model's content type as the `base_content_type`, and the page's specific content type as the `content_type`.
 * Queries that use the `PageRevision.objects` manager should be updated to use the `Revision.page_revisions` manager.
 * `Revision` queries that use `Page.id` should be updated to cast the `Page.id` to a string before using it in the query (e.g. by using `str()` or `Cast("page_id", output_field=CharField())`).
 * `Page` queries that use `PageRevision.page_id` should be updated to cast the `Revision.object_id` to an integer before using it in the query (e.g. by using `int()` or `Cast("object_id", output_field=IntegerField())`).
 * Access to `PageRevision.page` should be updated to `Revision.content_object`.

If you maintain a package across multiple Wagtail versions that includes a model with a `ForeignKey` to the `PageRevision` model, you can create a helper function to correctly resolve the model depending on the installed Wagtail version, for example:

```python
from django.db import models
from wagtail import VERSION as WAGTAIL_VERSION


def get_revision_model():
    if WAGTAIL_VERSION >= (4, 0):
        return "wagtailcore.Revision"
    return "wagtailcore.PageRevision"


class MyModel(models.Model):
    # Before
    # revision = models.ForeignKey("wagtailcore.PageRevision")
    revision = models.ForeignKey(get_revision_model(), on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

### `Page.get_latest_revision_as_page` renamed to `Page.get_latest_revision_as_object`

The `Page.get_latest_revision_as_page` method has been renamed to `Page.get_latest_revision_as_object`. The old name still exists for backwards-compatibility, but calling it will raise a `RemovedInWagtail50Warning`.

### `AdminChooser` replaced with `BaseChooser`

Custom choosers should no longer use `wagtail.admin.widgets.chooser.AdminChooser` which has been replaced with `wagtail.admin.widgets.chooser.BaseChooser`.

### `get_snippet_edit_handler` moved to `wagtail.admin.panels.get_edit_handler`

The `get_snippet_edit_handler` function in `wagtail.snippets.views.snippets` has been moved to `get_edit_handler` in `wagtail.admin.panels`.

### `explorer_breadcrumb` template tag has been renamed to `breadcrumbs`, `move_breadcrumb` has been removed

The `explorer_breadcrumb` template tag is not documented, however if used it will need to be renamed to `breadcrumbs` and the `url_name` is now a required arg.

The `move_breadcrumb` template tag is no longer used and has been removed.

### `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.menus.SubMenu` is deprecated

The `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.menus.SubMenu` class should no longer be used for constructing submenus of the admin sidebar menu. Instead, import `wagtail.admin.menu.Menu` and pass the list of menu items as the `items` keyword argument.

### `createSnippetChooser` replaced with `SnippetChooser` class

The JavaScript function `createSnippetChooser(id)` has been deprecated; user code should call `new SnippetChooser(id)` instead.

### URL route names for document and snippet apps have changed

If your code contains references to URL route names within the `wagtaildocs` or `wagtailsnippets` namespaces, these should be updated as follows:

* `wagtaildocs:chooser` is now `wagtaildocs_chooser:choose`
* `wagtaildocs:chooser_results` is now `wagtaildocs_chooser:choose_results`
* `wagtaildocs:document_chosen` is now `wagtaildocs_chooser:chosen`
* `wagtaildocs:chooser_upload` is now `wagtaildocs_chooser:create`
* `wagtailsnippets:list`, `wagtailsnippets:list_results`, `wagtailsnippets:add`, `wagtailsnippets:edit`, `wagtailsnippets:delete-multiple`, `wagtailsnippets:delete`, `wagtailsnippets:usage`, `wagtailsnippets:history`: These now exist in a separate `wagtailsnippets_{app_label}_{model_name}` namespace for each snippet model, and no longer take `app_label` and `model_name` as arguments.
* `wagtailsnippets:choose`, `wagtailsnippets:choose_results`, `wagtailsnippets:chosen`: These now exist in a separate `wagtailsnippetchoosers_{app_label}_{model_name}` namespace for each snippet model, and no longer take `app_label` and `model_name` as arguments.

### Auto-updating preview

As part of the introduction of the new live preview panel, we have changed the `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW` setting to be on (`True`) by default. This can still be turned off by setting it to `False`. The `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL` setting has been introduced for sites willing to reduce the performance cost of the live preview without turning it off completely.
